<h2 class="p6">PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>Praiseworthy as the task is of unifying the scattered
elements of our Canadian story, yet it will hardly
be maintained that such historical studies ought not to
be preceded by others of a more elementary character.
Herein, then, are chronicled the annals of an institution
coherent and compact&mdash;an isolated unit.</p>

<p>The Hudson's Bay Company witnessed the French dominion
in Northamerica rise to its extreme height, decline and disappear;
it saw new colonies planted by Britain; it saw them
quarrel with the parent State, and themselves become transformed
into States. Wars came and passed&mdash;European
Powers on this continent waxed and waned, rose and faded
away; remote forests were invaded by loyal subjects who
erected the wilderness into opulent provinces. Change,
unceasing, never-ending change, has marked the history of
this hemisphere of ours; yet there is one force, one institution,
which survived nearly all conditions and all <i>régimes</i>.
For two full centuries the Hudson's Bay Company existed,
unshorn of its greatness, and endures still&mdash;the one enduring
pillar in the New World mansion.</p>

<p>In pondering the early records of the Company, one truth
will hardly escape observation. It did not go forth amongst
the savages with the Bible in its hand. Elsewhere, an old
axiom, and true&mdash;first the missionary, then the soldier, then
the trader. In the case of the Company, this order has
been reversed. The French associations in Canada for the
collection and sale of furs were preceded by the Jesuits&mdash;brave,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VIII" id="Page_VIII">viii</a></span>
fearless, self-denying&mdash;whose deeds form the theme
of some of Parkman's most thrilling pages.</p>

<p>A few years since, in the solitudes of the West, two European
tourists were struck by the frequency with which they
encountered a certain mystic legend. Eager to solve its
meaning, they addressed a half-breed lounger at a small
station on the Canadian Pacific Railway.</p>

<p>"Tell us, my friend," they said, "what those three letters
yonder signify. Wherever we travel in this country we
encounter 'H. B. C.' We have seen the legend sewn on the
garments of Indians; we have seen it flying from rude forts;
it has been painted on canoes; it is inscribed on bales and
boxes. What does 'H. B. C.' mean?"</p>

<p>"That's <i>the Company</i>," returned the native grimly, "Here
Before Christ."</p>

<p>Might not the first missionary who, in 1818, reached York
Factory contemplate his vast cure, and say: Here, bartering,
civilizing, judging, corrupting, revelling, slaying, marching
through the trackless forest, making laws and having
dominion over a million souls&mdash;<i>here before Christ!</i></p>

<p>It is probable a day is at hand when all this area will be
dotted with farms, villages and cities, a time when its forests
will be uprooted and the plains of Rupert's Land and
the North-West Territory tilled by the husbandman, its
hills and valleys exploited by the miner; yet, certain spots
in this vast region must ever bear testimony to the hunter
of furs. Remote, solitary, often hungry and not seldom
frozen&mdash;the indomitable servant of the Great Fur Company
lived here his life and gave his name to mountain, lake
and river.</p>

<p>Whatsoever destiny has in store for this country, it can
never completely obliterate either the reverence and admiration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_IX" id="Page_IX">ix</a></span>
we have for brave souls, or those deeper feelings which
repose in the bosoms of so many Canadian men and women
whose forefathers lent their arms and their brains to the fur-trade.
The beaver and the marten, the fox and the mink,
may soon be as extinct as the bison, or no more numerous
than the fox and the beaver are to-day in the British Isles;
but this volume, imperfect as it is, may serve as a reminder
that their forbears long occupied the minds and energies
of a hardy race of men, the like of whose patience, bravery
and simple honest careers may not soon again be seen.</p>

<p>He who would seek in these pages the native romance,
the vivid colour, the absorbing drama of the Great North-West,
will seek, I fear, in vain. My concern has been chiefly
with the larger annals of the Hudson's Bay Company, its
history proper, which until now has not been compiled.</p>

<h2 class="p6">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<hr class="l15" />
<p>Mr. Beckles Willson has asked me to write a short
introduction for his forthcoming book on the Hudson's Bay
Company, and it gives me great pleasure to comply with his
request.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to know that this work has been undertaken
by a young Canadian, who has for some years had a
laudable desire to write the history of what he appropriately
calls "The Great Company," with whose operations the
development of the Western parts of Canada has been so
closely connected.</p>

<p>The history of the Company during the two centuries of
its existence must bring out prominently several matters
which are apt now to be lightly remembered. I refer to
the immense area of country&mdash;more than half as large as
Europe&mdash;over which its control eventually extended, the
explorations conducted under its auspices, the successful
endeavours, in spite of strenuous opposition, to retain its
hold upon what it regarded as its territory, its friendly relations
with the Indians, and, finally, the manner in which its
work prepared the way for the incorporation of the "illimitable
wilderness" within the Dominion.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that the fur-traders were the
pioneers of civilization in the far West. They undertook the
most fatiguing journeys with the greatest pluck and fortitude;
they explored the country and kept it in trust for
Great Britain. These fur-traders penetrated to the Rocky
Mountains, and beyond, into what is now known as British
Columbia, and even to the far north and northwest, in connection
with the extension of trade, and the establishment of
the famous "H. B. C." posts and forts, which were the leading
features of the maps of the country until comparatively
recent times. The names of many of these early explorers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XII" id="Page_XII">xii</a></span>
are perpetuated in its rivers and lakes; and many important
Arctic discoveries are associated with the names of officers of
the Company, such as Hearne, Dease, and Simpson, and, in
later times, Dr. John Rae.</p>

<p>The American and Russian Companies which were seeking
trade on the Pacific Coast, in the early days of the present
century, were not able to withstand the activity and enterprise
of their British rivals, but for whose discoveries and
work even British Columbia might not have remained British
territory. For many years the only civilized occupants of
both banks of the Columbia River were the fur-traders, and
it is not their fault that the region between it and the international
boundary does not now belong to Canada. Alaska
was also leased by the Hudson's Bay Company from Russia,
and one cannot help thinking that if that country had been
secured by Great Britain, we should probably never have
heard of the Boundary Question, or of disputes over the Seal
Fisheries. However, these things must be accepted as they
are; but it will not, in any case, be questioned that the work
of the Company prepared the way for the consolidation of
the Dominion of Canada, enabling it to extend its limits
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the international
boundary to the far north.</p>

<p>The principal business of the Company in the early days
was, of course, the purchasing of furs from the Indians, in
exchange for arms, ammunition, clothes and other commodities
imported from the United Kingdom. Naturally,
therefore, the prosperity of the Company depended largely
upon good relations being maintained with the Indians. The
white man trusted the Indians, and the Indians trusted the
white man. This mutual confidence, and the friendly relations
which were the result, made the transfer of the territory
to Canada comparatively easy when the time for the surrender
came. It is interesting to note also, that while intent upon
trading with the Indians, the Company did not neglect the
spread of civilizing influences among them. The result of
their wise policy is seen in the relations that have happily
existed since 1870 between the Government and the Indians.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIII" id="Page_XIII">xiii</a></span>
There has been none of the difficulties which gave rise to so
many disasters in the western parts of the United States.
Even in the half-breed disturbance in 1869-70, and in that of
1885, the Indians (with very few exceptions) could not be
induced to take arms against the forces of law and order.</p>

<p>Although the Red River settlement was inaugurated and
carried out under its auspices, it has been stated, and in terms
of reproach, that the Company did not encourage settlement
or colonization. The statement may have an element of
truth in it, but the condition of the country at the time must
be borne in mind. Of course, the fur trade and settlement
could not go on side by side. On the other hand, until the
country was made accessible, colonization was not practicable.
Settlers could not reach it without the greatest difficulty, even
for many years after the transfer of the territory took place,
or get their produce away. Indeed, until the different Provinces
of Canada became federated, and were thus in a
position to administer the country and to provide it with the
necessary means of communication, the opening up of its
resources was almost an impossibility. No single province of
Canada could have undertaken its administration or development,
and neither men nor money were available, locally, to
permit of its blossoming out separately as a Colony, or as a
series of Provinces.</p>

<p>The work of the Company is still being continued, although,
of course, under somewhat different conditions. The fur trade
is quite as large as ever it was, and the relations of the Company
are as cordial as of old with the Indians and other
inhabitants in the districts remote from settlement, in which
this part of the business is largely carried on. It has also
adapted itself to the times, and is now one of the leading
sources of supplies to the settlers in Manitoba, the North-West
Territories, and British Columbia, and to the prospectors and
miners engaged in developing the resources of the Pacific
province. Besides, it has a very large stake in the North-West,
in the millions of acres of land handed over to it,
according to agreement, as the country is surveyed. In fact,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIV" id="Page_XIV">xiv</a></span>
it may be stated that the Hudson's Bay Company is as inseparably
bound up with the future of Western Canada as it has
been with its past.</p>

<p>There are, of course, many other things that might be mentioned
in an introduction of this kind, and there is room
especially for an extended reference to the great and wonderful
changes that have been apparent in Manitoba, the North-West
Territories, and British Columbia, since, in the natural
order of things, those parts of Canada passed out of the direct
control of the Company. The subject is so fascinating to me,
having been connected with the Company for over sixty
years, that the tendency is to go on and on. But the different
details connected with it will doubtless be dealt with by
Mr. Beckles Willson himself much better than would be
possible in the limited time at my disposal, and I shall
therefore content myself with stating, in conclusion, that I
congratulate the author on the work he has undertaken, and
trust that it will meet with the success it deserves. It cannot
fail to be regarded as an interesting contribution to the history
of Canada, and to show, what I firmly believe to be the case,
that the work of the Hudson's Bay Company was for the
advantage of the Empire.</p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER I.<br />
<br />
1660-67.</h2>

<p class="hanging">
Effect of the Restoration on Trade&mdash;Adventurers at Whitehall&mdash;The
East India Company Monopoly&mdash;English interest in North America&mdash;Prince
Rupert's claims&mdash;The Fur Trade of Canada&mdash;Aim of the
Work.</p>

<p class="p2">That page in the nation's history which records the years
immediately following the Restoration of the Stewarts to the
English throne, has often been regarded as sinister and inauspicious.
Crushed and broken by the long strain of civil
war, apparently bankrupt in letters, commerce and arms,
above all, sick of the restraints imposed upon them by the
Roundheads, the nation has too often been represented as
abandoning itself wholly to the pursuit of pleasure, while
folly and license reigned supreme at court. The almost
startling rapidity with which England recovered her pride of
place in the commercial world has been too little dwelt upon.
Hardly had Charles the Second settled down to enjoy his
heritage when the spirit of mercantile activity began to make
itself felt once more. The arts of trade and commerce, of
discovery and colonization, which had languished under the
Puritan ascendancy, revived; the fever of "Imperial Expansion"
burst out with an ardour which no probability of failure
was able to cool; and the court of the "Merry Monarch"
speedily swarmed with adventurers, eager to win his favour
for the advancement of schemes to which the chiefs of the
Commonwealth would have turned but a deaf ear.</p>

<p>Of just claimants to the royal bounty, in the persons of
ruined cavaliers and their children, there was no lack. With
these there also mingled, in the throng which daily beset the
throne with petitions for grants, charters, patents and monopolies,&mdash;returned
free-booters, buccaneers in embryo, upstarts
and company-promoters. Every London tavern and coffee-house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
resounded with projects for conquest, trade, or the
exploitation of remote regions.</p>

<p>From the news-letters and diaries of the period, and from
the minutes of the Council of Trade and the Royal Society,
one may form an excellent notion of the risks which zealous
capital ran during this memorable decade.</p>

<p>For two centuries and more mercantile speculation had
been busy with the far East. There, it was believed, in the
realms of Cathay and Hindustan, lay England's supreme
market. A large number of the marine expeditions of the
sixteenth century were associated with an enterprise in which
the English nation, of all the nations in Europe, had long
borne, and long continued to bear, the chief part. From the
time of Cabot's discovery of the mainland in 1498, our
mariners had dared more and ventured oftener in quest of
that passage through the ice and barren lands of the New
World which should conduct them to the sunny and opulent
countries of the East.</p>

<p class="sidenote">English
right to
Hudson's
Bay.</p>

<p>The mercantile revival came; it found the Orient robbed
of none of its charm, but monopoly had laid its hand on
East India. For over half a century the East India Company
had enjoyed the exclusive right of trading in the Pacific
between the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn, and the
merchants of London therefore were forced to cast about for
other fields of possible wealth. As far as North America was
concerned, the merest reference to a map of this period will
reveal the very hazy conception which then prevailed as to
this vast territory. Few courtiers, as yet, either
at Whitehall or Versailles, had begun to concern
themselves with nice questions of frontier, or the
precise delimitation of boundaries in parts of
the continent which were as yet unoccupied,
still less in those hyperborean regions described by the
mariners Frobisher, Button and Fox. To these voyagers,
themselves, the northern half of the continent was merely a
huge barrier to the accomplishment of their designs.</p>

</div>
<p>Yet in spite of this destructive creed, it had long been a
cardinal belief in the nation that the English crown had by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
virtue of Cabot's, and of subsequent discoveries, a right to
such territories, even though such right had never been
actively affirmed.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1664 the King granted the territory now comprised
in the States of New York, New Jersey and Delaware
to his brother, the Duke of York, and the courtiers became
curious to know what similar mark of favour would be
bestowed upon his Majesty's yet unrewarded cousin, Prince
Rupert, Duke of Cumberland and Count Palatine of the
Rhine.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The Duke of York succeeded in wresting his new Transatlantic
possession from the Dutch, and the fur-trade of New
Amsterdam fell into English hands. Soon afterwards the
first cargo of furs from that region arrived in the Thames.</p>

<p>Naturally, it was not long before some of the keener-sighted
London merchants began to see behind this transaction vast
possibilities of future wealth. The extent of the fur-trade
driven in Canada by the French was no secret.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Twice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
annually, for many years, had vessels anchored at Havre,
laden with the skins of fox, marten and beaver, collected and
shipped by the Company of the Hundred Associates or their
successors in the Quebec monopoly. A feeling was current
that England ought by right to have a larger share in this
promising traffic, but, it was remarked, "it is not well seen by
those cognizant of the extent of the new plantations how
this is to be obtained, unless we dislodge the French as we
have the Dutch, which his present Majesty would never
countenance."</p>

<p>Charles had little reason to be envious of the possession by
his neighbour Lewis, of the country known as New France.</p>

<p class="sidenote">French
fur-trade.</p>

<p>Those tragic and melancholy narratives, the "Relations des
Jesuites," had found their way to the English Court. From
these it would seem that the terrors of cold,
hunger, hardships, and Indian hostility, added
to the cost and difficulties of civil government,
and the chronic prevalence of official intrigue, were hardly
compensated for by the glories of French ascendancy in
Canada. The leading spirits of the fur-trade then being
prosecuted in the northern wilds, were well aware that they
derived their profits from but an infinitesimal portion of
the fur-trading territory; the advantages of extension and
development were perfectly apparent to them; but the difficulties
involved in dealing with the savage tribes, and the
dangers attending the establishment of further connections
with the remote interior, conspired to make them content
with the results attained by the methods then in vogue. The
security from rivalry which was guaranteed to them by their
monopoly did not fail to increase their aversion to a more
active policy. Any efforts, therefore, which were made to
extend the French Company's operations were made by
Jesuit missionaries, or by individual traders acting without
authority.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, was the state of affairs in the year 1666 when
two intrepid bushrangers, employees of the old Company,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
dissatisfied with their prospects under the new <i>régime</i>, sought
their way out from the depths of the wilderness to Quebec,
and there propounded to the Intendant, Jean Talon, a scheme
for the extension of the fur-trade to the shores of Hudson's
Bay. This enterprising pair saw their project rejected, and
as a sequel to this rejection came the inception and establishment
of an English association,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> which subsequently obtained
a charter from the King, under the name and title of "The
Governor and Company of Merchants-Adventurers trading
into Hudson's Bay."</p>

<p>To narrate the causes which first led to the formation of
this Company, the contemporary interest it excited, the thrilling
adventures of its early servants, of the wars it waged with
the French and drove so valiantly to a victorious end; its
vicissitudes and gradual growth; the fierce and bloody
rivalries it combated and eventually overbore; its notable
expeditions of research by land and sea; the character of the
vast country it ruled and the Indians inhabiting it; and last
but not least, the stirring and romantic experiences contained
in the letters and journals of the Great Company's factors and
traders for a period of above two centuries&mdash;such will be the
aim and purpose of this work.</p>

<br />
1659-1666.</h2>

Return to Quebec and lay their Scheme before the Governor&mdash;Repulsed

</p>

<p>The year 1659, notable in England as the last of the
Puritan ascendancy and the herald of a stirring era of
activity, may be reckoned as the first with which the annals
of the Great Company are concerned. It is in this year
that we first catch a glimpse of two figures who played
an important part in shaping its destinies. Little as they
suspected it, the two intrepid fur-traders, Groseilliers and
Radisson, who in the spring of that year pushed their way
westward from Quebec to the unknown shores of Lake
Superior, animated in this, as in all their subsequent exploits,
by a spirit of adventure as well as a love of gain, were to
prove the ancestors of the Great Company.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Groseilliers'
first
marriage.</p>

<p>Medard Chouart, the first of this dauntless pair, was born in
France, near Meaux, and had emigrated to Quebec when
he was a little over sixteen years old. His father had been
a pilot, and it was designed that the son should succeed
him in the same calling. But long before this intention
could be realized he fell in with a Jesuit, returned from
Canada, who was full of thrilling tales about the New France
beyond the seas; and so strongly did these anecdotes, with
their suggestion of a rough and joyous career in the wilderness,
appeal to his nature, that he determined to take his
own part in the glowing life which the priest depicted. In
1641 he was one of the fifty-two <i>emigrés</i> who sailed with
the heroic Maissoneuve from Rochelle. Five years later
we find him trading amongst the Hurons, the tribe whose
doom was already sealed by reason of the enmity and
superior might of the Iroquois; and at the close
of another year comes the record of his first
marriage. The bride is Etienne, the daughter
of a pilot, Abraham Martin of Quebec, the
"eponymous hero" of that plateau adjoining Quebec where,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
a century later, was to take place the mortal struggle between
Wolfe and Montcalm.</p>

<p>It was probably soon after this marriage that Chouart
adopted the title "des Groseilliers," derived from a petty
estate which his father had in part bequeathed to him.</p>

<p>Not long did his wife survive the marriage; and she died
without leaving any legacy of children to alleviate his loss.
But the young adventurer was not destined to remain for
any length of time disconsolate. Within a year of his wife's
death, there arrived in the colony a brother and sister named
Pierre and Marguerite Radisson, Huguenots of good family,
who had been so persistently hounded in France by the
persecution which sought to exterminate their community,
that the one key to happiness had seemed to them to lie
beyond the seas. No sooner had their father died than
they bade farewell to France and sailed for Canada, there to
start a new life amidst new and more tranquil surroundings.</p>

<p>With this couple young Groseilliers soon struck up an
acquaintance; and so rapidly did the intimacy ripen that
before long he was united, to the sister in matrimony, and
to the brother in a partnership for the pursuit of commercial
adventure. The double union proved doubly fortunate; for
Marguerite seems to have made a well-suited wife, and Pierre,
though in birth and education superior to Groseilliers, was
no whit less hardy and adventurous, nor in any respect less
fitted for the arduous tasks which their rough life imposed
upon them. The two speedily became fast friends and associates
in enterprise, and thus united they soon took their place
as the leading spirits of the settlement at Three Rivers.
Here, in 1656, Radisson married for the first time, his bride
being a Mlle. Elizabeth Herault, one of the few Protestant
young women in the whole of Canada. Groseilliers, who
had been long disgusted at the priestly tyranny of which
he had seen so much in Canada, probably needed but little
inducement to embrace the Protestant religion, if indeed this
had not been stipulated upon at the time of his marriage.
At all events, we now find him reputed to be among the
Protestants of the Colony; some of whom were, in spite of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
the bitter prejudice against them, the boldest and most
successful spirits the fur-trading community of that period
had to show.</p>

</div>
<p class="sidenote">Radisson

Miss Kirke.</p>

<p>Radisson, like Groseilliers,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> had the misfortune to lose his
wife soon after their marriage; but, like his comrade, he too
sought consolation in a fresh marriage. This
time he allied himself with the daughter of a
zealous English Protestant, who afterwards became
Sir John Kirke. It was to the brothers
of this Kirke that the great Champlain, thirty years before,
had surrendered Quebec.</p>

<p>With this introduction to the characters of the two remarkable
men whose fortunes were to become so closely entwined
with that of the Hudson's Bay Company, we may pass to
their early efforts to extend the fur-trade beyond those limits
which the distracted and narrow-minded officers of the Compagnie
des Cent Assocés, thought it necessary to observe.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>Reaching the shore of Lake Superior in the early summer
of 1659, Radisson and Groseilliers travelled for six days in
a south-westerly direction, and then came upon a tribe of
Indians incorporated with the Hurons, known as the Tionnontates,
or the Tobacco Nation. These people dwelt in the
territory between the sources of the Black and Chippeway
rivers, in what is now the State of Wisconsin, whence, in
terror of the bloody enmity of the Iroquois, they afterwards
migrated to the small islands in Lake Michigan at the
entrance of Green Bay.</p>

<p>During their temporary sojourn with this branch of the
unhappy Hurons the two pioneering traders heard constant
mention of a deep, wide, and beautiful river&mdash;comparable to
the St. Lawrence&mdash;to the westward, and for a time they
were half tempted by their ever-present thirst for novelty to
proceed in that direction. Other counsels, however, seem to
have prevailed; for instead of striking out for the unknown
river of the west they journeyed northward, and wintered
with the Nadouechiouecs or Sioux, who hunted and fished
among the innumerable lakes of Minnesota. Soon afterwards
they came upon a separate band of war-like Sioux, known
as the Assiniboines, a prosperous and intelligent tribe, who
lived in skin and clay lodges and were "familiar with the use
of charcoal."</p>

<p class="sidenote">A Route to
the Bay.</p>

<p>From these Assiniboines, Radisson and Groseilliers first
heard of the character and extent of that great bay to the
north, named by the English marine explorers
"Hudson's Bay," which was to be the scene of
their later labours; and not only did they glean
news of its nature, but they also succeeded in obtaining
information as to the means of reaching it.</p>

<p>In August, 1660, the two adventurers found their way back
to Montreal, after over a year's absence. They were accompanied
by three hundred Indians, and in possession of sixty
canoes laden with furs, which they undertook to dispose of
to the advantage of the savages and themselves. As they
had anticipated, they found the little colony and its leaders
deeply interested in their reports of the extent and richness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
of the fur-producing countries to the westward, as well as
in their description of the unfamiliar tribes inhabiting that
region. The sale of the furs having resulted in a handsome
profit, Groseilliers announced to his brother-in-law his intention
of making the journey on his own account. There was
no dearth of volunteers eager to embark in the enterprise,
and from those who offered their services he chose six
Frenchmen&mdash;<i>coureurs des bois</i> or bushrangers; and having
provided himself with an ample outfit, turned his footsteps
once more to the prairies of the west, while Radisson went
to rejoin his wife and sister at Three Rivers.</p>

<p>On the eve of his departure the Jesuit Fathers, distrusting
Groseilliers' religious proclivities and suspecting that he might
attempt to influence the Assiniboines, insisted upon one of
their number accompanying him. The priest chosen for
this arduous mission was the aged missionary Réné Ménard,
who, in spite of his physical frailty was still undaunted by
any prospect of peril; though he was, on this occasion,
prevailed upon to allow his servant Guérin to accompany
him. It was the priest's last journey. When Groseilliers
again reached Montreal, after a season in the wilderness as
prosperous as its forerunner, he bore the mournful news
that Ménard had been massacred and his body, beyond
question, devoured by a fierce band of Indians.</p>

<p>This voyage, besides showing lucrative results, also proved
a memorable one for Groseilliers, inasmuch as it was during
his winter's sojourn with the distant Assiniboines that he
acquired information which affected his whole subsequent
career. There can be no question that it was the knowledge
he obtained from this tribe of a convenient route to
Hudson's Bay, by way of Lake Superior, and of a system of
trade with the tribes dwelling on or in proximity to that
unknown sea, that caused him to set out once again in May,
1662, for the west. He was accompanied by ten men, all
of whom were disaffected towards the powers which then
controlled the fur-trade in New France, and the combination
of good fortune and <i>esprit de corps</i> among his followers proved
so successful that when, after a year's absence, he returned to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
the eastern colonies, the number of furs he brought back was
sufficiently great to render a simultaneous disposal of all the
packs inadvisable. He adopted the wise course of dividing
them into three consignments, and these were sold respectively
at Montreal, Three Rivers, and Quebec. Henceforward,
but one idea possessed Groseilliers&mdash;a journey to the great
fur-lands of the north. It should be his life's work to exploit
the fur-trade of Hudson's Bay. Already he saw himself rich&mdash;richer
even than the merchant-princes of old Rochelle.</p>

<p class="sidenote">A new fur
Company.</p>

<p>But alas for his plans, the official laxity and dissensions
which had made it possible for himself and others
thus to infringe with impunity, the general monopoly
granted by the King came to a sudden end.
A fresh patent for a new Company was issued
by the Crown; a new Governor, M. d'Avagour, entered upon
the scene, and the rigorous measures enacted against private
traders drove many of these over to the English and the
Dutch.</p>

<p>A commission from M. d'Avagour, dated the 10th of May,
1663, conveyed permission to one M. Couture to remove with
five men to the bottom of the Great Bay to the North of
Canada, consequent upon the requisition of some Indians,
who had returned to Quebec to ask for aid to conduct and
assist them in their affairs. This same Couture afterwards
certified, or the French Government certified in his stead,
that he really undertook this voyage, and "erected anew
upon the lands at the bottom of the said Bay a cross and
the arms of the King engraved on copper, and placed
between two plates of lead at the foot of a large tree."
Much justifiable doubt has been cast upon this story, and
at a much later period, when French and English interests
were contesting hotly for the sovereignty of the territory
surrounding Hudson's Bay, an expedition was sent in search
of the boasted memorials, but no trace of the cross or the
copper escutcheon could be found. There seems every probability
that the allegation, or the subsequent statement of
an allegation of this description, was false.</p>

<p>Groseilliers had thus to reckon with the new fur-trading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
proprietors of Quebec, who were to prove themselves less
complaisant than the old. They instantly interdicted traders
from going in search of peltries; reasoning that the produce
would ultimately find its way into their hands, without the
need of any such solicitation. And though Groseilliers persistently
explained to them that their policy of interdiction
was really a short-sighted one; that the Indians could not
be always depended upon to bring their own furs to the
Company's mart; and that no great time would elapse before
the English or Dutch would push their way westward to
Lake Superior, and so acquire an unequalled opportunity
of developing the resources of the northern regions; neither
his criticism and advice (founded on personal knowledge of
the unstable Indian character) nor the apprehensions of
rivalry, which he showed good grounds for entertaining, had
any power to move the officials of the Hundred Associates.
Neither argument, entreaty, nor prognostications of danger
would induce them to look with any favour upon Groseilliers'
project, or even entertain his proposals.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Groseilliers
in Boston.</p>

<p>Groseilliers afterwards hinted that it was prejudice against
his adopted religion which really lay at the bottom of this
complete rejection of his scheme, and also accounted for the
Company's refusal to avail themselves of his services, otherwise
than as a mere salaried servant. It was at this juncture
that he sought the advice of Radisson, and it is not unlikely
that it was the counsels of his brother-in-law which induced
him to resolve upon a bold step in the furtherance of his
cherished project. It was well-known that the English
colonists settled in New England were putting forth the
strongest efforts to secure a share of the fur-trade of the
North. Their allies, the redoubtable Iroquois, had upon
several occasions way-laid and plundered the Huron tribes,
who were conveying their cargoes to Quebec and Montreal,
and had delivered these into the hands of the English. Farther
westward, the Dutch were indefatigable in their endeavours
to divert the fur-traffic of the North from the St. Lawrence
to the Hudson. But the Dutch had been vanquished by the
English; New Amsterdam was now New York; and it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
English brains and English money which now controlled
the little colony and the untravelled lands which lay beyond
it. It was to the English, therefore, that the indomitable
adventurer now determined to apply. Madame
Radisson had relatives in Boston; her father
was an intimate friend of the Governor. Relying
on such influences as these, but still more on the
soundness of his project, Groseilliers made his way to Boston
by way of Acadia.</p>

<p>Early in 1664 we find the Mother Superior of the Ursuline
Nuns at Quebec writing thus of Groseilliers:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<p>"As he had not been successful in making a fortune, he
was seized with a fancy to go to New England to better
his condition. He excited a hope among the English that
he had found a passage to the Sea of the North."</p>

<p>The good Mother Superior was deceived. It was no part
of Groseilliers' plan to seek a passage to the Sea of the
North; but one can hardly doubt that he found it highly
politic that such a report should obtain currency in Quebec.
The fur-trade of the North, and the fur-trade alone, was
Groseilliers' lode-stone; but in spite of all it had cost him
to acquire the knowledge he already possessed, he was ready
to abandon the land and fresh water route, and seek the
shores of Hudson's Bay from the side of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>Doubtless many causes operated to alter his original plan;
but there can be little question that the most potent was the
opposition of the Canadian Company. Yet had the sea route
not existed, even the opposition of the Company would not
have sufficed to baulk him of a fulfilment of his designs. He
would not have been the first French trader, even at that
early day in the history of the rival colonies, to circumvent
his countrymen, and, taking advantage of their confined area
of activity, to conduct negotiations with the Indians surrounding
the most distant outposts of their territory. The
proceeding would have been hazardous had the Company
possessed the force necessary to assert its rights to the
trade of the whole northern and north-western country; but
the new company would not as yet possess the force. The
most real danger Groseilliers had to fear was that, if he
persisted in his endeavours to draw away the trade of the
northern tribes, he might be outlawed and his property, and
that of his brother-in-law Radisson, confiscated. Groseilliers
had left his wife and his son in Canada, and he therefore
went to work with considerable caution.</p>

<p>It has been asserted, and perhaps with excellent point,
that Groseilliers may have been very powerfully influenced
in the abandonment of his land and fresh water route by
obtaining an entirely new idea of the configuration of
northern North America. In the maps which were likely at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
that time to have found their way to Quebec, the northern
regions are but very dimly defined; and with the knowledge
of geography gained only from these maps Groseilliers could
hardly have realized the accessibility of the approach by sea.
It seems likely therefore that the change of route was not
even thought of until Groseilliers had had his interview with
Radisson; it was probably Radisson&mdash;with his superior
geographical knowledge and more thorough comprehension
(through his kinship with the Kirkes, all famous mariners) of
the discoveries made by the English in the northern parts&mdash;who
advocated the sea-route. The idea must have grown
upon him gradually. His countrymen took it for granted
that the whole northern country was theirs, apparently
assuming the sole mode of access to be by land. The sea
route never seems to have occurred to them, or if they
thought of it at all, it was dismissed as dangerous and
impracticable for purposes of commerce. The configuration
of the northern country, the form and extent of the seas,
certainly the character of the straits and islands, were to
them little known. Secure in what they regarded as nominal
possession, forgetful that English mariners had penetrated
and named these northern waters, the officials of the Canada
Company were content to pursue a policy of <i>laissez faire</i> and
to deprecate all apprehensions of rivalry.</p>

<p>Singular coincidence! More than a century was to elapse
and another Company with ten times the wealth, the power,
the sovereignty wielded by this one: not French&mdash;for France
had then been shorn of her dominion and authority&mdash;but
English, scorning the all-conquering, all-pervading spirit of
mercantile England, was to pursue the same policy, and to
suffer the loss of much blood and treasure in consequence
of such pursuit.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Groseilliers

patrons.</p>

<p>In Boston, the main difficulty which Groseilliers encountered
was a scarcity of wealth. His scheme was
approved by many of the leading spirits there,
and his assertions as to the wealth of the fur-bearing
country were not doubted. But at that
period the little Puritan colony was much put to it to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
carry out projects for its own security and maintenance,
not to mention plans for enrichment much nearer home.
And it was pointed out to him that so long as schemes
which were regarded as essential to safety could only be
with difficulty supported, no pecuniary assistance could be
rendered for an extraneous project, however promising its
nature.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There were in Boston at this time, however, four personages
whom the King had sent as envoys, in 1664, to force the
Dutch to evacuate Manhattan, and who were also a kind
of commission instructed to visit the English colonies, and
to hear and rule their complaints. They were Richard
Nichols, Robert Carr, George Cartwright and Samuel Maverick.
One of these, Colonel Carr, it is said, strongly urged
Groseilliers to proceed to England and offer his services to
the King.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Zachary
Gillam.</p>

<p>Although, therefore, he was unable to secure there the
patronage he desired, Groseilliers' visit to Boston was not
quite barren of profit. He fell in besides with an intelligent
sea-faring man, Zachary Gillam, who was
then captain and part-owner of a small vessel,
the <i>Nonsuch</i>, with which he plied a trade between
the colony and the mother country. Gillam expressed himself
eager to assist in the project as far as lay in his power,
and offered his services in case an equipment could be found.
A long correspondence passed between Groseilliers and his
brother-in-law in Canada, the latter very naturally urging that
as the New England project had failed, it would be advisable
not to seek further aid from the English, but that, as nothing
was to be expected from the Canada Company, or the merchants
of Canada, it would be as well to journey to France,
and put the matter before the French Court.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<p>Groseilliers seems to have agreed to this; and he wrote
back begging Radisson to join him in Boston with the
object of accompanying him to France. In June, 1665,
both the adventurers set sail in the <i>Nonsuch</i> for Plymouth,
whence in all likelihood they proceeded direct to Havre.</p>

<p>It would be unprofitable, and at best but a repetition, to
describe the difficulties Groseilliers and his brother-in-law
met with in Paris, the petitions they presented and the
many verbal representations they made. In the midst of
their ill-success Colonel Carr came to Paris. There is extant
a letter of his to Lord Arlington. "Having heard," says he,
"by the French in New England of a great traffic in
beavers" to be got in the region of Hudson's Bay, and
"having had proofs of the assertions" of the two adventurers,
he thought "the finest present" he could make to his majesty
was to despatch these men to him.</p>

<p>The ambassador pondered on this and at last decided to
entrust Groseilliers with a letter to a certain prince&mdash;a friend
of his&mdash;and a patron of the Arts and Sciences. Leaving
Radisson despondent in Paris, therefore, the other adventurer
crossed the Channel and found himself, with a beating
heart, for the first time in the English capital.

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER III.<br />
<br />
1667-1668.</h2>

<p class="hanging">
Prince Rupert&mdash;His Character&mdash;Serves through the Civil War&mdash;His
Naval Expedition in the West Indies&mdash;Residence in France&mdash;And
ultimately in London&mdash;He receives Groseilliers and introduces
him to the King.
</p>

<p>It was a fortunate chance for Medard Chouart des Groseilliers
that threw him, as we shall see, into the hands of such
a man as Rupert, Prince of England and Bohemia.</p>

<p>A dashing soldier, a daring sailor, a keen and enlightened
student, a man of parts, and at the age of forty-seven still
worshipping adventure as a fetish and irresistibly attracted by
anything that savoured of novelty, there was perhaps no
other noble in England more likely to listen to such a
project as the Canadian was prepared to pour into his ear,
no prince in the whole of Europe more likely to succumb
to its charm.</p>

<p>Rupert may, on good grounds, be considered one of the
most remarkable men of that age. He was the third son of
the King of Bohemia by the Princess Elizabeth Stuart,
eldest daughter of James I. In common with most German
princes he had been educated for the army; and, as he used
to observe himself in after years, there was no profession
better fitted for a prince provided he could be allowed to
fight battles. It was a maxim of his that the arts of
patience, of strategy, and parleying with the enemy should
be left to statesmen and caitiffs; and it can be said with
truth of Rupert that no one could possibly have acted more
completely in accordance with his rule than himself. "Than
Prince Rupert," wrote a chronicler at his death, "no man was
more courageous or intrepid. He could storm a citadel but,
alas, he could never keep it. A lion in the fray, he was a
very lamb, tho' a fuming one, if a siege was called for."</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Prince Rupert</span>.<br />
(<i>After a painting by Vandyke.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Youthful, high-spirited and of comely appearance, Rupert
found his way to England during his twentieth year to offer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
his services to his royal uncle, King Charles I. The country
was then on the brink of a civil war. Parliament had proved
refractory. The Puritan forces had already assembled; and
in a few months the first blow was struck. The young
Prince placed himself at the head of a troop of cavaliers
and soon all England was ringing with the fame of his
exploits. On more than one occasion did Cromwell have
reason to remember the prowess of "fiery Prince Rupert."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">The Great
Company's
Founder.</p>

<p>Such dashing tactics and spontaneous strategy, however,
could not always prevail. He was charged with
the defence of Bristol, with what result is a
matter of common historical knowledge. His
own observation on this episode in his career is
an admirable epitome of his character, as comprehensive as
it is brief, "I have no stomach for sieges."</p>

<p>Charles wrote him a letter of somewhat undue severity, in
which he exhibited all the asperity of his character as well
as his ignorance of the situation. Perhaps if he had realized
that the circumstances would have rendered the retention
of Bristol impossible even to a Caesar or a Turenne, he
might have written in a more tolerant strain; but it is not
very probable. In any case the letter cut Rupert to the
heart.</p>

<p>Before his final overthrow Charles, indeed, relented from
his severity, and created his nephew Earl of Holdernesse and
Duke of Cumberland, granting him also a safe conduct to
France, which was honoured by the Parliamentary leaders.</p>

<p>Thenceforward for a few years Rupert's career is directly
associated with the high seas. On the revolt of the fleet from
the control of the Commonwealth he made his way on board
of one of the King's vessels, and figured in several naval
battles and skirmishes. But even here the result was a
foregone conclusion. The bulk of the ships and crews still
remaining loyal were rapidly captured or sunk, and the
remnant, of which Rupert assumed command, was exceedingly
small. He began by sailing to Ireland, whither he
was pursued by Popham and Blake, who very quickly
blocked him up in the harbour of Kinsale. But the Puritan
captains were deceived if, as it appears, they fancied the
Prince an easy prey. Rupert was no more the sailor than
he had been the soldier to brook so facile a capture. He
effected a bold escape, just under their guns. But realizing
his helplessness to engage the Puritan fleet in open combat,
he inaugurated a series of minor conflicts, a kind of guerilla
warfare, which, to our modern notions, would best be classified
under the head of privateering, to use no harsher term.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">A
resemblance
to piracy.</p>

<p>The Spanish Main was at that period an excellent ground
for operations of this kind, and with very little delay Rupert
was soon very busy with his small but gallant fleet in those
waters. Here the commander of the little <i>Reformation</i> and
his convoys spent three years with no little pecuniary profit
to himself and crew. On more than one occasion his exploits
in the neighbourhood of the West Indies bore no distant
resemblance to piracy, as he boarded impartially
not only English, Dutch and Spanish ships, but
also those flying the English colours. Howbeit
on one occasion, being advised that the master of
one craft was a Frenchman, he generously forebore to reap
the profits of his valour out of respect to the monarch with
whom both his cousins, Charles and James, had found a
refuge. He insisted that the plunder should be restored.
On the whole, however, Rupert seems to have had little
conscience in the matter. The mere excitement of such
adventures alone delighted him, although it would scarce
have satisfied his crews. There is reason to suppose that
he himself was not actuated primarily by the mere love of
gain. It is known that several of his captains returned with
large fortunes; Rupert's own profits were long a matter for
conjecture. Even at his death they could not be approximately
ascertained; for while he left a goodly fortune,
comprising jewels valued at twenty thousand pounds, much
of this fortune was acquired legitimately since these stirring
days of his youth; and no small part was derived from his
share in the Hudson's Bay Company.</p>

<p>The exiled prince, in whose name Rupert was always
extremely careful to conduct his depredations on the prosperous
commerce of the West Indies, does not appear
himself to have derived much material advantage therefrom.
It was true the terror of his name was already
industriously spread in those waters, and this perhaps was
some consolation for the contempt with which it was regarded
by the insolent and usurping Puritans. In a newspaper of the
period, "Pleasant Passages," I find under date of October 15,
1652, the following quaint comment:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>"Prince Rupert hath lately seized on some good prizes and
he keeps himself far remote; and makes his kinsman, Charles
Stuart, make a leg for some cullings of his windfalls."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Loss of the
"Reformation."</p>

<p>Rupert after a time transferred the scene of his operations
to the Azores, where after some collisions with the Portuguese,
he met with a catastrophe so severe as to compel him to
permanently desist from his predatory operations.
A violent storm came on, and the <i>Reformation</i>
and his entire fleet perished, no fewer
than 360 souls being lost on the flagship. It
was with difficulty that the Prince and twelve of his companions,
including his brother Maurice, escaped with a portion
of the treasure. A contemporary news-writer records that
Rupert had landed at Nantes with ten thousand pounds or so,
"'tis said by those best informed. The King hath sent his
carriage to meet him at Orleans."</p>

<p>Charles, who was of course the King mentioned, was then
in high hopes of obtaining funds from his cousin Rupert,
which might enable him to make an effort for the recovery
of his crown. But the king, minus a throne, was destined to
be disappointed. Rupert did not yet seem prepared to
disgorge, acting, it is easy to see, on advice.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>"No money for his Majesty out of all this," forms the
burden of numerous letters written by the faithful Edward
Hyde, afterwards to become the Lord Chancellor Clarendon.</p>

<p>"The money the King should have received!" he complains,
in an epistle addressed to Sir Richard Browne. "Why,
Rupert is so totally governed by the Lord Keeper, Sir
Edward Herbert, that the King knows him not. The King
hasn't had a penny, and Rupert pretends the King owes him
more than ever I was worth."</p>

<p>Hyde had no love for the Lord Keeper of the exiled court;
but according to several contemporary writers, the buccaneering
Prince looked upon Herbert as "an oracle," (to quote the
diarist Evelyn) and chose for a time at least to spend most of
his gains in his own way.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>But Rupert did not persist in the course suggested by his
friend Herbert. Soon afterwards he is announced to have
made Charles a present of two thousand pounds, for which
the King expressed his profound satisfaction by attaching
him immediately to the royal household.</p>

<p>A little later, in 1654, there is recorded the following,
printed in the "Loyal Gentleman at Court."</p>

<p>"Prince Rupert flourishes highly here, with his troop of
blackamoors; and so doth his cousin Charles, they having
shared the money made of his prize goods at Nantz."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rupert's
Secretary.</p>

<p>It was in this year that Rupert seems to have engaged
one William Strong, a cavalier who had lost all he
possessed, to replace John Holder as his private
secretary, a circumstance worthy of mention, inasmuch
as it was Strong who was to figure later
as the intermediary between his master and the adventurer
Groseilliers in London.</p>

<p>There is a passage of this period which describes Rupert
as he appeared in Paris, "a straight and comely man, very
dark-featured," probably owing to exposure in warm climates,
"with jet black hair and a great passion for dress." He is
often referred to in news-letters and diaries of the time under
the sobriquet of the "Black Prince."</p>

<p>"Our Black Prince Ruperte" records one, "has had a
narrow escape from drowning in the Seine; but by the help
of one of his blackamoors escaped."</p>

<p>This was perhaps the period of the closest friendship
between Charles and his Bohemian cousin; inasmuch as a
decided coolness had already arisen on the part of the
exiled monarch and his brother, the Duke of York. This
coolness at length terminated in a quarrel, and a separation
in the ensuing year at Bruges. Indeed, the Duke advised
Rupert to have no further dealings with his royal brother,
a proposition which the Prince wisely, and fortunately for
himself, neglected to entertain, for had he acted otherwise,
it is extremely doubtful if at the Restoration he
would have been in a position to demand any favours at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
the monarch's hands. James, probably on this score, never
afterwards professed much cordiality towards his kinsman,
Rupert.</p>

<p class="sidenote">A patron
of commerce.</p>

<p>In the years between 1656 and 1665, Rupert spent much
of his time in cultivating science and the arts. There are a
hundred evidences of his extraordinary ingenuity. A mere
list of his devices and inventions, as printed at his decease in
1682, almost entitles him to be considered the Edison of
his day, a day in which inventors were rare. Yet in the
period before the outbreak of the Dutch war his activity was
by no means limited to the laboratory which he had constructed
for himself in Kings' Bench Walk, Temple, or to
his study at Windsor. None could have exhibited greater
versatility. In April, 1662, he was sworn a member of the
Privy Council; he also became a member of the Tangier
Commission; and in December of the same year he was
unanimously elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He
already cut a prominent figure as a patron of
commerce, being appointed a member of the
Council of Trade, and taking an active part in
the promotion of commerce with Africa as a member of the
Royal African Company.</p>

<p>With all his sympathies and activities, however, it is very
clear that Rupert did not enjoy very great favour at Court.
He was suspected of holding his royal cousin in not very
high esteem, and of entertaining pronounced opinions on
the subject of the royal prerogative; whatever the cause,
his influence at Whitehall was not always fortunate. Seeing
his councils neglected on several occasions, he kept aloof, and
the courtiers, taking as they supposed their cue from their
master, made light of his past achievements, finding in his
surrender of the city of Bristol, a specially suitable subject
for their derision.</p>

<p>In 1664 we find in Pepys' Diary that Rupert had been
"sent to command the Guinny Fleet. Few pleased, as he is
accounted an unhappy [<i>i.e.</i>, unlucky] man." As a consequence
of these sentiments, which Rupert was soon destined
by his valour to alter, one Captain Holmes was sent instead.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Nevertheless it was known at Court that Rupert desired a
naval employment, and as the authorities found that their
estimate of his abilities was not mistaken, he was in 1666
selected to command the fleet against the Dutch, in conjunction
with the Duke of Albemarle. His conduct was
most exemplary. On one occasion he wrested a victory
from the Dutch, and again in the month of June beat them
soundly, pursuing them into their own harbour. Returning
to England on the cessation of hostilities, he found himself
in much higher favour at Court. But with a single exception,
which I will proceed to relate, Rupert sought no favours at
the hands of his royal relations from this moment until the
day of his death. He was content to pursue an even career
in comparative solitude, a circumstance for which a serious
physical ailment, which soon overtook and for a time threatened
his life, was no doubt in some measure responsible.
The fire which distinguished his youth was exchanged, we
are told, for good temper and sedateness. He was credited
with writing an autobiography, but if the report be true, it
is a pity there remains no tangible evidence of such an
intention. It is certain that his correspondence was so
large as to entail the continuous employment of a secretary,
William Strong; but prior to the inception of the Hudson's
Bay project, it probably related almost entirely to his
chemical and scientific researches and achievements.</p>

<p>In May, 1667, the Prince's secretary opened a letter from
Lord Preston, then English ambassador at Paris, intimating
that one M. des Groseilliers, a Canadian fur-trader, would be
the bearer of an introductory letter from himself to his highness.
He was convinced that the French were managing the
fur-trade of New France very clumsily, and he added that
Monsieur des Groseilliers seemed as much disaffected towards
the new company lately chartered by the French king as
towards the old. There is no reason, in the writer's opinion,
why English men of commerce should not avail themselves of
opportunities and instruments, such as the weak policy of their
rivals now afforded, for obtaining a share in the northern
fur-trade.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Rupert
sends for
Groseilliers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Rupert was at first unable to see the adventurer
who had travelled so far. The cause of the delay is
not quite clear, but it appears plausible to suppose that it
was due to the Prince's illness. He had already undergone
the operation of trepanning, and it was found necessary to
still continue treatment for the disease to which he had been
subject. At any rate it was a fortnight or three weeks before
the first interview took place, and the Prince and the French
trader did not meet until the 4th of June. The result of
this interview was that Prince Rupert promised
his credit for the scheme. Three days later he
sent for Groseilliers, who found on his arrival
in the Prince's apartments several gentlemen,
among whom Lord Craven, Sir John Robinson and Mr. John
Portman appear to have been numbered. In a week from
this conference both Radisson, Groseilliers and Portman
travelled to Windsor Castle at the request of the Prince.
There is no record of what then passed, but there is mention
of a further meeting in a letter written by Oldenburgh, the
secretary of the Royal Society to Robert Boyle, in America.</p>

<p>"Surely I need not tell you from hence" he wrote, "what
is said here with great joy of the discovery of a north-west
passage by two Englishmen and one Frenchman, lately
represented by them to his Majesty at Oxford and, answered
by the grant of a vessel to sail into Hudson's Bay and
channel into the South Sea."</p>

<p>From this it would appear that Radisson was then
popularly supposed to be an Englishman, probably on
account of his being Sir John Kirke's son-in-law, and also
that the matter was not settled at Windsor, but at Oxford.</p>

<p>Then came a long delay&mdash;during which there is nothing
worthy of record. It was too late to attempt a voyage to
the Bay in 1667, but during the autumn and winter Groseilliers
and Radisson could console themselves with the assurance
that their scheme had succeeded.</p>

<p>For at last the adventurers had met with a tangible success.
A ship was engaged and fitted out for them; and it was
none other than that commanded by their Boston friend,
Captain Zachary Gillam.

</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 3rd of June, 1668, without
attracting undue attention from the riparian dwellers and
loiterers, a small skiff shot out from Wapping Old Stairs.
The boatman directed its prow towards the <i>Nonsuch</i>, a
ketch of fifty tons, then lying at anchor in mid-Thames,
and soon had the satisfaction of conveying on board in
safety his Highness Prince Rupert, Lord Craven, and Mr.
Hays, the distinguished patrons of an interesting expedition
that day embarking for the New World. Radisson
was to have accompanied the expedition but he had met
with an accident and was obliged to forego the journey
until the following year.</p>

<p>All hands being piped on deck, a salute was fired in
honour of the visitors. Captain Zachary Gillam and the
Sieur des Groseilliers received the Prince, and undertook to
exhibit, not without a proper pride, their craft and its cargo.
Subsequently a descent was made to the captain's cabin,
where a bottle of Madeira was broached, and the success of
the voyage toasted by Rupert and his companions. The party
then returned to Wapping, amidst a ringing cheer from captain
and crew. By ten o'clock the <i>Nonsuch</i> had weighed anchor
and her voyage had begun.</p>

<p>The passage across the Atlantic was without any incident
worthy of record. The vessel was fortunate in encountering
no gales or rough seas. The leisure of Groseilliers and Captain
Gillam was employed chiefly in discussing the most advantageous
landfall, and in drawing up plans for a settlement for
fort-building and for trade with the tribes. By the 4th of
August they sighted Resolution Isle, at the entrance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Hudson's Straits. They continued fearlessly on their course.
During their progress the shores on either hand were occasionally
visible; and once a squall compelled them to go so
near land as to descry a band of natives, the like of whom
for bulk and singularity of costume, Groseilliers and the
captain had never clapped eyes upon. They were right in
judging these to be Esquimaux.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The
"Nonsuch"
in the Bay.</p>

<p>On the seventh day of their passage amongst those
narrow channels and mountains of ice which had
chilled the enthusiasm and impeded the progress
of several daring navigators before them, the
forty-two souls on board the <i>Nonsuch</i> were rewarded
with a sight of Hudson's Bay.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Already, and long before the advent of the <i>Nonsuch</i>, Hudson's
Bay had a history and a thrilling one.</p>

<p>In 1576 Sir Martin Frobisher made his first voyage for
the discovery of a passage to China and Cathay by the
north-west, discovering and entering a strait to which he
gave his name. In the following year he made a second
voyage, "using all possible means to bring the natives to
trade, or give him some account of themselves, but they
were so wild that they only studied to destroy the English."
Frobisher remained until winter approached and then returned
to England. A further voyage of his in 1578-79 made no
addition to the knowledge already derived.</p>

<p>Six years later Captain John Davis sailed from Dartmouth,
and in that and succeeding voyages reached the Arctic circle

through the straits bearing his name. He related having
found an open sea tending westward, which he hoped
might be the passage so long sought for; but the weather
proved too tempestuous, and, the season being far advanced,
he likewise returned to a more hospitable clime. After this
there were no more adventures in this quarter of the world
until 1607, when Captain Hudson explored as far north as
80 degrees 23 minutes. On his third voyage, two years later,
he proceeded a hundred leagues farther along the strait, and
arriving at the Bay resolved to winter there.</p>

<p>Hudson was preparing for further exploration when Henry
Green, a profligate youth, whom he had taken into his house
and preserved from ruin by giving him a berth on board
without the knowledge of the owners, conspired with one
Robert Ivett, the mate, whom Captain Hudson had removed,
to mutiny against Hudson's command. These turned the
captain, with his young son John, a gentleman named Woodhouse,
who had accompanied the expedition, together with
the carpenter and five others, into a long-boat, with hardly
any provisions or arms. The inhuman crew suffered all the
hardships they deserved, for in a quarrel they had with the
savages Green and two of his companions were slain. As
for Ivett, who had made several voyages with Hudson, and
was the cause of all the mischief, he died on the passage
home. Habbakuk Prickett, one of the crew, who wrote all
the account we have of the latter part of the voyage, was a
servant of Sir Dudley Diggs. Probably his master's influence
had something to do with his escape from punishment.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Henry
Hudson's
fate.</p>

<p>This was the last ever seen or heard, by white
men, of Henry Hudson, and there is every likelihood
that he and the others drifted to the bottom
of the Bay and were massacred by the savages.</p>

<p>In the year of Hudson's death Sir Thomas Button, at the
instigation of that patron of geographical science, Prince
Henry, pursued the dead hero's discoveries. He passed
Hudson's Straits and, traversing the Bay, settled above two
hundred leagues to the south-west from the straits, bestowing
upon the adjacent region the name of New Wales. Wintering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
in the district afterwards called Port Nelson, Button made
an investigation of the boundaries of this huge inland sea,
from him named Button's Bay.</p>

<p>In 1611 came the expedition of Baffin; and in 1631
Captain James sailed westward to find the long-sought
passage to China, spending the winter at Charlton Island,
which afterwards became a depot of the Company. Captain
Luke Fox went out in the same year, but his success was no
greater than his predecessors in attaining the object of his
search. He landed at Port Nelson and explored the country
round about, without however much advantage either to
himself or to his crew. When the <i>Nonsuch</i> arrived a quarter
of a century had passed since an European had visited
Hudson's Bay.</p>

<p>After much consultation, the adventurers sailed southward
from Cape Smith, and on Sept. 29 decided to cast anchor at
the entrance to a river situated in 51 degrees latitude. The
journey was ended; the barque's keel grated on the gravel, a
boat was lowered and Gillam and Groseilliers went promptly
ashore. The river was christened Rupert's River,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and it being
arranged to winter here, all hands were ordered ashore to
commence the construction of a fort and dwellings, upon
which the name of King Charles was bestowed. Thus our
little ship's-load of adventurers stood at last on the remotest
shores of the New World; all but two of them strangers in a
strange land.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The first
Fort.</p>

<p>For three days after their arrival Groseilliers and his party
beheld no savages. The work of constructing the fort went
on apace. It was, under Groseilliers' direction, made of logs,
after the fashion of those built by the traders and Jesuits
in Canada; a stockade enclosing it, as some protection from
sudden attack. The experienced bushranger deemed it best
not to land the cargo until communication had
been made with the natives; and their attitude,
friendly or otherwise, towards the strangers ascertained.
No great time was spent in waiting; for on the
fourth day a small band of the tribe called Nodwayes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
appeared, greatly astonished at the presence of white settlers
in those parts. After a great deal of parleying, the Indians
were propitiated by Groseilliers with some trifling gifts, and
the object of their settlement made known. The Indians
retired, promising to return before the winter set in with all
the furs in their possession, and also to spread the tidings
amongst the other tribes.</p>

<p>The autumn supply proved scanty enough; but the adventurers
being well provisioned could afford to wait until the
spring.</p>

<p>Groseilliers' anticipations were realized; but not without
almost incredible activity on his part. He spent the summer
and autumn, and part of the ensuing winter, in making excursions
into the interior. He made treaties with the Nodwayes,
the Kilistineaux, the Ottawas, and other detachments of the
Algonquin race. Solemn conclaves were held, in which the
bushranger dwelt&mdash;with that rude eloquence of which he was
master, and which both he and Radisson had borrowed from
the Indians&mdash;on the superior advantages of trade with the
English. Nor did his zeal here pause; knowing the Indian
character as he did, he concocted stories about the English
King and Prince Rupert; many a confiding savage that
year enriched his pale-face vocabulary by adding to it
"Charles" and "Rupert," epithets which denoted that transcendent
twain to whom the French bushranger had transferred
his labours and his allegiance.</p>

<p>The winter of 1668-69 dragged its slow length along, and
in due course the ground thawed and the snow disappeared.
No sooner had the spring really arrived than strange natives
began to make their appearance, evincing a grotesque eagerness
to strike bargains with the whites for the pelts which they
brought from the bleak fastnesses. By June it was thought
fit that Captain Gillam should return with the <i>Nonsuch</i>,
leaving Groseilliers and others at the fort. Gillam accordingly
sailed away with such cargo as they had been able to muster,
to report to the Prince and his company of merchants the
excellent prospects afforded by the post on Rupert's River,
provided only the Indians could be made aware of its existence,
and the French trade intercepted.

</div>

<p class="sidenote">Groseilliers'
presence of
mind.</p>

<p>Chouart des Groseilliers in all his transactions with the
natives exhibited great hardihood of speech and action; and
few indeed were the occasions which caught him unawares. It
happened more than once, for instance, that
some of the wandering Algonquins or Hurons
recognized in this smooth-tongued leader of
the English fort the same French trader they
had known at Montreal, and the French posts on the
western lakes, and marvelled much that he who had then
been loudly crying "up King Lewis and the Fleur-de-lis,"
should now be found surrounded by pale-faces of a different
speech, known to be the allies of the terrible Iroquois.
Groseilliers met their exclamations with a smile; he represented
himself as profoundly dissatisfied with the manner in
which the French traders treated his friends the Indians,
causing them to travel so far and brave such perils to bring
their furs, and giving them so little in return. "Tell all your
friends to come hither," he cried, "and King Charles will give
you double what King Lewis gives."</p>

<p>In August, 1669, a gun was heard by Groseilliers and his
English and native companions. With great joy the bushranger
ran from the fort to the point of land commanding the
Bay, thinking to welcome back Gillam and the expected
<i>Nonsuch</i>. But as the vessel came nearer he saw it was not the
<i>Nonsuch</i>, and for a moment he was dismayed, uncertain
whether or not to make himself known. But the colour of the
flag she carried reassured him; he caused a fire to be made,
that the attention of those on board might be attracted by
the smoke; and was soon made aware that his signal had
been seen. The sloop headed up Rupert's River, and a boat
containing three men was lowered from her side. Greater
still was Groseilliers' joy when he recognized amongst the
approaching party in the boat his brother-in-law, Pierre
Radisson. These two sturdy children of the wilderness
embraced one another with great affection and set to work
diligently to barter. The <i>Nonsuch</i> arrived safely in the
Thames in the month of August.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Satisfaction
of the
Adventurers.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to exaggerate the satisfaction of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
company of London merchants at hearing the results of
their first venture. They had taken counsel
together, and considering the importance of
securing a charter of monopoly from the King
to be paramount, Prince Rupert was persuaded
to use his good offices to this end.</p>

<p>Charles was doubtless relieved to hear that his cousin
Rupert desired no greater favour. He expressed himself
ready to grant such a patent, provided the Lord Chancellor
approved. A charter was accordingly drawn up forthwith
at the instance of the Prince, in the usual form of
such charters; but the winter of 1669-70 elapsed without
its having received the royal assent. Indeed it was not
until the second day of May that Prince Rupert, presenting
himself at Whitehall, received from the King's own hands
one of the most celebrated instruments which ever passed
from monarch to subject, and which, though almost incessantly
in dispute, was perpetuated in full force throughout
two centuries.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">The
Charter.</p>

<p>This document was granted to Prince Rupert and seventeen
nobles and gentlemen, comprising the Duke of Albemarle,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Earls Craven and Arlington, Lord Ashley,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Sir John Robinson,
Sir Robert Vyner, Sir Peter Colleton, Sir Edward Hungerford,
Sir Paul Neele, Sir John Griffith, Sir Philip Carteret,
Knights and Baronets; James Hays, John Kirke, Francis
Wellington, William Prettyman, John Fenn, Esquires, and
John Portman, "Citizen and Goldsmith," incorporated into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
a company, with the exclusive right to establish settlements
and carry on trade at Hudson's Bay. The
charter recites that those adventurers having,
at their own great cost, undertaken an expedition
to Hudson's Bay in order to discover a new passage
into the South Sea, and to find a trade for furs, minerals
and other commodities, and having made such discoveries
as encouraged them to proceed in their design, his Majesty
granted to them and their heirs, under the name of "The
Governor and Company of Merchants-Adventurers trading
into Hudson's Bay," the power of holding and alienating
lands, and the sole right of trade in Hudson's Strait, and
with the territories upon the coasts of the same.</p>

<p>They were authorized to get out ships of war, to erect
forts, make reprisals, and send home all English subjects
entering the Bay without their license, and to declare war
and make peace with any prince or people not Christian.</p>

<p>The territory described as Rupert's Land consisted of the
whole region whose waters flowed into Hudson's Bay. It
was a vast tract&mdash;perhaps as vast as Europe&mdash;how much
vaster was yet to be made known, for the breadth of the
Continent of North America had not yet been even approximately
ascertained. For all the Adventurers knew the Pacific
Ocean was not distant more than one hundred miles west of
the Bay.</p>

<p>In the same merry month of May the <i>Prince Rupert</i> set sail
from Gravesend, conveying a new cargo, a new crew, and a
newly appointed overseer of trade, to the Company's distant
dominions.

<p class="hanging">
Danger Apprehended to French Dominion&mdash;Intendant Talon&mdash;Fur
Trade Extended Westward&mdash;News of the English Expedition
Reaches Quebec&mdash;Sovereign Rights in Question&mdash;English Priority
Established.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">French
activity.</p>

<p>Although neither the Governor, the Fur Company nor the
officials of the Most Christian King at Quebec, had responded
favourably to the proposals of Groseilliers, yet they were not
long in perceiving that a radical change in their trade policy
was desirable. Representations were made to M. Colbert and
the French Court. It was even urged that France's North
American dominions were in danger, unless a
more positive and aggressive course were pursued
with regard to extension. These representations,
together with the knowledge that the Dutch on
the south side of the St Lawrence and in the valley of the
Hudson had unexpectedly acknowledged allegiance to the
King of England, determined Lewis to evince a greater
interest in Canadian affairs than he had done hitherto.</p>

<p>Mezy was recalled, to die soon afterwards; and Daniel de
Remin, Seigneur de Courcelles, was despatched as Provincial
Governor. A new office was created, that of Intendant of
Justice, Police and Finance; and Jean Talon&mdash;a man of
ability, experience and energy&mdash;was made the first Intendant.
Immediately upon his arrival, he took steps to confirm the
sovereignty of his master over the vast realms in the West;
and to set up the royal standard in the region of the Great
Lakes.</p>

<p>In 1668 Talon returned to France, taking with him one
of those hardy bushrangers (<i>coureurs de bois</i>) who passed
nearly the whole of their lives in the interior and in the
company of the Hurons. This man seems to have cut a
very picturesque figure. He had been scalped, and bore
about his person many grim mutilations and disfigurements,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
to bear witness to his adventures amongst unfriendly tribes.
He accompanied Talon in the capacity of servant or bodyguard,
and appears to have had little difficulty in making
himself an object of infinite interest to the lackeys and
concierges of Paris. On the Intendant's return to Canada,
this daring personage, Peray by name, is alluded to as
Talon's most trusted adviser with regard to the western
country and the tribes inhabiting it. In one of the Intendant's
letters, dated February 24th, 1669, he writes that
Peray had "penetrated among the western nations farther
than any Frenchman; and had seen the copper mine on
Lake Huron. This man offers to go to that mine and
explore either by sea, or by the lake and river&mdash;such communication
being supposed to exist between Canada and
the South Sea&mdash;or to the Hudson's Bay."</p>

<p>French activity had never been so great in the new world
as in the years between Groseilliers' departure from Quebec
and the period when the English fur-traders first came in
contact with the French on the shores of Hudson's Bay,
thirteen years later.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1669, the active and intelligent Louis
Joliet, with an outfit of 4,000 livres, supplied him by the
Intendant, penetrated into an unknown region and exhibited
the white standard of France before the eyes of the astonished
natives.</p>

<p>This also was the period which witnessed the exploits of La
Salle, and of Saint Lusson. Trade followed quickly on their
heels. In March, 1670, five weeks before the charter was
granted to the Great Company, a party of Jesuits arriving
at Sault Ste. Marie found twenty-five Frenchmen trading
there with the Indians. These traders reported that a most
lucrative traffic had sprung up in that locality. Coincident
with the tidings they thus conveyed to Talon, the
Intendant learnt from some Algonquins who had come to
Quebec to trade, that two European vessels had been seen
in Hudson's Bay.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Colbert and
the Company.</p>

<p>"After reflecting," he wrote to Colbert, "on all the nations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
that might have penetrated as far north as that, I can only
fall back on the English, who, under the conduct
of one named Groseilliers, in former times an
inhabitant of Canada, might possibly have attempted
that navigation, of itself not much known and not
less dangerous. I design to send by land some men of
resolution to invite the Kilistinons,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> who are in great numbers
in the vicinity of that Bay, to come down to see us
as the Ottawas do, in order that we may have the first
handling of what the savages bring us, who, acting as retail
dealers between ourselves and those natives (<i>i.e.</i>, the Kilistinons),
make us pay for this roundabout way of three or four
hundred leagues."</p>

<p>The rivalry of French and English north of the St. Lawrence
had begun. With that rivalry began also from this
moment that long series of disputes concerning the sovereignty
of the whole northern territories, which has endured
down to our own generation.</p>

<p class="sidenote">A much
vexed
controversy.</p>

<p>Few historical themes have ever been argued at greater
length or more minutely than this&mdash;the priority of discovery,
occupation, and active assumption of sovereignty over those
lands surrounding Hudson's Bay, which for two centuries
were to be held and ruled by the Hudson's Bay Company.
The wisest jurists, the shrewdest intellects, the
most painstaking students were destined to
employ themselves for over a century in seeking
to establish by historical evidence, by tradition
and by deduction, the "rights" of the English or of the
French to those regions.</p>

<p>A great deal of importance has been attached to the fact
that in 1627 a charter had been granted by Lewis XIII. to
a number of adventurers sent to discover new lands to the
north of the River of St. Lawrence. The clause of the
charter reads as follows:&mdash;"Le fort et habitation de Quebec,
avec tout le pays de la Nouvelle France dite Canada, tant
le long des Cotes depuis la Floride que les predecesseurs
Rois de Sa Majeste ont fait habiter en rangeant les Cotes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
de la Mer jusqu'au Cercle Artique pour latitude, et de
longitude depuis l'Ile de Terreneuve tirant a l'ouest au
Grand Lac dit la Mer douce et au dela que de dans les
terres, et le long des Rivieres qui y passant et se dechargent
dans le fleuve dit St. Laurent, ou autrement la grande Riviere
du Canada, et dans tous les autres fleuves qui se portent a
la mer." But most writers have omitted to verify the fact
that in this charter to the French Company, the only portions
of land granted to the French Company are the lands or
portions of lands which had already been occupied by the
Kings of France, and the object of the charter was simply to
give them an exclusive right of trade therein. Thus it was
clearly indicated that the charter did not go further than the
land occupied by the predecessors of Lewis XIV.</p>

<p>"New France was then understood to include the whole
region of Hudson's Bay, as the maps and histories of the
time, English and French, abundantly prove." This is a
broad assertion, which is not supported by the early discoverers
nor by the historians of that time. Charlevoix in
his history described New France as being an exceedingly
limited territory. There is in l'Escarbot a description which
shows that at that time the whole territory known as New
France extended but a few miles on each side of the St.
Lawrence. Charlevoix says regretfully at that time that the
giving up of this territory did not amount to much, as New
France was circumscribed by very narrow limits on either
side of the St Lawrence.</p>

<p>When an examination is made into the facts of the voyages
and expeditions alleged to have been undertaken by the
French prior to 1672, it is difficult to arrive at any but a
certain conclusion&mdash;that the French claims had no foundation
in fact.</p>

<p>It was then asserted, and long afterwards repeated, that
Jean Bourdon, the Attorney-General in 1656, explored the
entire coast of Labrador and entered Hudson's Bay. For
this assertion one is unable to find any historical support;
certainly no record of any kind exists of such a voyage.
There is a record in 1655, it is true, that Sieur Bourdon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
then Attorney-General, was authorized to make a discovery
of <i>Mer du Nord</i>; and in order to comply with that <i>arrét</i> of
the Sovereign Council at Quebec, he actually made an
attempt at such discovery. Bourdon left Quebec on May
2nd, 1657, and an entry in the records proves his return on
August 11th of the same year. It is manifestly impossible
that such a voyage could have been accomplished between
these dates. But a reference to this business in the Jesuit
relations of the succeeding year is sufficiently convincing.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>It is there recorded that on the "11th of August, there
appeared the barque of M. Bourdon, which having descended
the Grand River on the north side, sailed as far as the 55th
degree, where it encountered a great bank of ice, which
caused it to return, having lost two Hurons that it had
taken as guides. The Esquimaux savages of the north
massacred them and wounded a Frenchman with three
arrows and one cut with a knife."</p>

<p>Another statement employed to strengthen the French
claim to sovereignty was, that Father Dablon and Sieur de
Valiere were ordered in 1661 to proceed to the country about
Hudson's Bay, and that they accordingly went thither. All
accounts available to the historian agree that the worthy
father never reached the Bay.</p>

<p class="sidenote">La Couture's
mythical
voyage.</p>

<p>Another assertion equally long-lived and equally ill-founded,
was to the effect that one Sieur La Couture, with five men,
proceeded overland to the Bay, and there took possession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
of it in the King's name. There is no account of this voyage
in <i>Charlevoix</i>, or in the "Relations des Jesuites," or in the
memoir furnished by M. de Callieres to the Marquis de
Denonville. This memoir, which was penned in 1685, or
twenty-one years after the time of which it
treated, set forth that La Couture made the
journey for purposes of discovery. Under the
circumstances, particularly owing to the strong
necessity under which the French were placed to find some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
shadow of right for their pretensions, M. de Callieres' memoir
has been declared untrustworthy by competent authorities.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1663, Sieur Duquet, the King's Attorney for Quebec,
and Jean L'Anglois, a Canadian colonist, are said to have
gone to Hudson's Bay by order of Sieur D'Argenson, and
to have renewed possession by setting up the King's arms
there a second time. Such an order could hardly have
been given by D'Argenson, because he had left Canada on
September 16th, 1671, two years before this pretended order
was given to Sieur Duquet.</p>

<p class="sidenote">French
falsehoods
and fallacies.</p>

<p>It has been attempted to explain the silence of the "Relations
of the Jesuits" concerning Bourdon's voyage, by asserting
that they were naturally anxious that members of their
own society should be the pioneers in discovery, and that
therefore many important discoveries were never brought to
light in their relations because they were not made by Jesuits.
It is enough to say that such an argument cannot apply to
the voyage of Dablon. He was a Jesuit, a man in whom the
interests of the society were centred, and if a voyage had
been made by him, no doubt a great deal of prominence
would have been given to it. On the contrary, in the third
volume of the "Jesuit Relations," 1662, we find this Jesuit,
Father Dablon, describing an unsuccessful voyage that he
made. There can be no doubt that he attempted a voyage.
A portion of this relation is written by himself, and he calls
it, "Journal du Premier Voyage Fait Vers la Mer du Nord."
The first portion of it is most important and conclusive, as
showing that De Callieres, in his memoir to M. De Seignely,
twenty-one years afterwards, must have been
speaking from hearsay, and without any authentic
documents on which to base his assertions.
Dablon says that the highest point which he did
reach was Nekauba, a hundred leagues from Tadoussac, and
that subsequently he returned; and this is from a report of
this journey written by himself. Some have attempted
to raise a doubt as to the identity of the Dablon in De
Callieres' memoir, with the Dablon of the "Relations des
Jesuites." But at the end of one of the volumes is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
complete list of all the Jesuits, pioneers both of the faith
and in the way of discovery, and there is only one Dablon
mentioned. Another inaccuracy of this memoir is as to
the trip of Duquet, under an order said to have been given
by Sieur D'Argenson. There can be no doubt that at the
time this pretended order was given, D'Argenson had left
Canada.</p>

<p>On the whole it may be as well for the reader to dismiss
the French pretensions. They are no longer of interest,
save to the hair-splitting student of the country's annals: but
in their day they gave rise to a wilderness of controversy,
through which we in the twentieth century may yet grope
vainly for the light. For all practical purposes the question
of priority was settled forever by the Ontario Boundary
Commission of 1884. Let us turn rather to behold to what
account the Honourable Adventurers turned their new
property.

<p>On the seventeenth day of November, 1671, the wits,
beaux and well-to-do merchants who were wont to assemble
at Garraway's coffee-house, London, were surprised by a
placard making the following announcement:&mdash;"On the fifth

</div>

<p>Such was the notice of the first official sale of the Company.
Up to this date, the peltries brought back in their
ships had been disposed of by private treaty, an arrangement
entrusted chiefly to Mr. John Portman and Mr. William
Prettyman, both of whom appear to have had considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
familiarity with the European fur-trade. The immediate
occasion of this sale is a trivial matter. The causes lying
behind it are of interest.</p>

<p>Among the numerous houses which cured and dealt in
furs at this period, both in London and Bristol, there were
none whose business seems to have been comparable, either
in quantity or quality, to that of the great establishments
which flourished in Leipsic and Amsterdam, Paris and
Vienna. Indeed, it was a reproach continually levelled at
the English fur-dressers that such furs as passed through
their hands were vastly inferior to the foreign product; and
it is certain that it was the practice of the nobles and
wealthier classes, as well as the municipal and judicial
dignitaries, for whose costume fur was prescribed by use
and tradition, to resort not to any English establishment,
but to one of the cities above-mentioned, when desirous of
replenishing this department of their wardrobe. Hitherto,
then, the Company had had but little opportunity of extending
its trade, and but little ground to show why an intending
purchaser should patronize its wares. But the superiority
both in the number and quality of the skins which now
began to arrive seems to have encouraged the directors to
make a new bid for public custom; and as the purchasing
public showed no disposition to visit their warehouses they
determined to take their wares to the public.</p>

<p>This sale of the Company, however, the first, as it subsequently
proved, of a series of great transactions which during
the past two centuries have made London the centre of the
world's fur-trade, did not take place until the twenty-fourth
of January. It excited the greatest interest.
Garraway's was crowded by distinguished men,
and both the Prince of Wales and the Duke of
York, besides Dryden, the poet, were among the spectators.
There are some lines attributed to him, under date of 1672,
which may have been improvised on this occasion.</p>

<p>A number of purchases seem to have been made by
private parties; but the bulk of the undressed beaver-skins
probably went to fur merchants, and there is good reason
to believe that the majority found their way into the hands
of Portman and Prettyman. Beaver seems on this occasion
to have fetched from thirty-five to fifty-five shillings&mdash;a
high figure, which for a long time was maintained. But the
Company showed considerable sagacity by not parting with
its entire stock of furs at once. Only the beaver-skins were
disposed of at this sale; the peltries of moose, marten,
bear and otter were reserved for a separate and subsequent
auction.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Meeting at
John Horth's.</p>

<p>Prior to its incorporation, and for a year afterwards,
the Company does not seem to have pursued any formal
course with regard to its meetings. At first, they met at
the Tower, at the Mint, or at Prince Rupert's house in Spring
Garden. Once or twice they met at Garraway's. But at a
conclave held on November 7th, 1671, it was resolved that a
definite procedure should be established with regard both
to the time and place of meeting, and to the keeping of the
minutes and accounts. These latter, it was ordered, were
forthwith to be rendered weekly to the General Court, so
that the adventurers might be conversant with all sales,
orders and commissions included in the Company's dealings.
Employees' accounts were also to be posted up; and the
same regulation was applied to the lists of goods received
for the two ships then lying in the Thames. It
was further decreed that the weekly meetings
should take place at Mr. John Horth's office,
"The Excise Office," in Broad Street, pending the building
of a "Hudson's Bay House."</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, a "General Court" of the adventurers
was held, at which the Prince, Lord Ashley, Sir John
Robinson, Sir Peter Colleson, Sir Robert Viner, Mr. Kirke
and Mr. Portman were in attendance. We catch a thoroughly
typical glimpse of Prince Rupert at this meeting; sober business
was not at all to his taste, and at a very early stage in
the proceedings he feigned either indisposition or another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
appointment, and took his departure. A hint, however, may
possibly have been given to him to do so, for, no sooner was
the door closed behind him, than his friend Lord Ashley
introduced a very delicate topic which was entered into by
all those present. It concerned nothing less than Prince
Rupert's profits, which up to this time seem to have been
very vaguely defined.</p>

<p>Lord Ashley spoke for the Prince and he seems to have
demanded some definite payment besides a share in the
enterprise; but there is no record of an agreement or of any
exact sum, nor is there any basis for the conjecture that his
share was ten thousand pounds. The charter of monopoly was
an important one, and the King certainly not the man to fail
in appreciating its value; but how much he did out of good
will to his kinsman, and how much out of consideration for
his own profit, will never be known. A perusal of the vast
quantity of manuscript matter which exists relating to this
arrangement leads to the conclusion that Charles sold the
charter out of hand. And indeed one pamphleteer, intent
on defaming the Company in 1766, even goes so far as to
profess actual knowledge of the sum paid to his Majesty
by the adventurers. Upon a consideration of all the speculations
advanced, I have come to the conclusion that it is
highly improbable that the King received any immediate
pecuniary advantage whatever on account of the charter.
There is no shadow of evidence to support the charge;
and there is at least some presumptive evidence against it.
Charters were both commonly and cheaply given in those
days. Even where consideration was given, the amount was
insignificant. In 1668, for example, Charles transferred the
province of Bombay, which had come to the British Crown
as portion of the dower of Catherine of Braganza, to the
East India Company for an annual rent of no more than
£10. On the whole then the data, such as they are, strongly
favour the belief that he granted the charter simply in the
cause of friendship and at the urgent instance of his cousin;
while, as an additional motive, it was probably also urged
upon him that a charter boasting the royal signature would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
be a virtual assertion of his dominion over territory which
was always somewhat in dispute.</p>

<p>Prince Rupert himself in any case was paid a lump sum
by the adventurers, but the amount will probably never be
known.</p>

<p>The early meetings of the Company seem to have been
largely occupied in considering the question of cargoes. This
was, no doubt, a very important business. The Company
appear to have had two precedents which, in part, they naturally
adopted, those of the Dutch (or West India Company)
and the French Company. The East India Company's practice
could have afforded them little assistance. They also
struck out a line for themselves, and in their selection of goods
for the purposes of barter they were greatly guided by the
advice of Radisson, who had a very sound conception of the
Indian character. From the first the Company rejected the
policy of seeking to exchange glass beads and gilded kickshaws
for furs. Not that they found it inexpedient to include
these trifles in their cargoes: for we read in one of the news-letters
of 1671, speaking of the doings at Garraway's:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hither came Mr. Portman, to whom, reports says, is
entrusted the purchase of beads and ribbons for the American
savages by the new Adventurers, and who is charged with
being in readiness to bargain for sackfuls of child's trinkets
as well as many outlandish things, which are proper for barter.
He takes the rallying in great good-humour."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Solid
character of
the
merchandise.</p>

<p>Long before the Company was thought of, the manufacture
of beads and wampum for the New England trade had
been going on in London. But beads and jewellery, it was
argued, were better suited for the African and East Indian
trade. It was Radisson who pointed out with great propriety
that the northern tribes would become most
useful to the Company if they were provided
with weapons for killing or ensnaring the game,
as well as with the knives, hatchets and kettles,
which were indispensable for dressing it, and for
preparing pemmican. And his advice was taken on this, as
on most other points. Thus for the <i>Prince Rupert</i> and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
<i>Imploy</i>, which were to sail in the following spring, the following
cargo was prescribed by Radisson and Captain Gillam:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Cargo">
<tr>
<td class="tdr">500</td><td>fowling pieces, and powder and shot in proportion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdr">500</td><td>brass kettles, 2 to 16 gallons apiece.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdr">30</td><td>gross of knives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdr">2,000</td><td>hatchets.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>But it is curious to note how this list of exports was
continually added to. For instance, one of the Company on
one occasion rose at the weekly meeting and stated that he
had been told by an experienced Indian trader that scarlet
cloth was very highly esteemed among the Indians.</p>

<p>"I hear," said he, "that an Indian will barter anything
he possesses for a couple of yards of scarlet cloth and a
few dyed feathers."</p>

<p>Whereupon, the chairman turned to the original adventurer
in the region controlled by the Company.</p>

<p>"What does Mr. Radisson say to this?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Mr. Radisson, "that the honourable
adventurer does not understand the Indian trade as well as
I do. He forgets that Indians are of many races; and that
what will suit the case and attract the cupidity of an Indian
far to the south, will have little effect on the northern tribes.
An Iroquois would think more of a brass nail than of twenty
yards of scarlet cloth. In the north, where we have built a
factory, the Indians are more peaceful; but they do not care
much for kickshaws and coloured rags. They, too, esteem
powder and shot and the means of discharging them. But
they are just as fond, particularly Eskimaux, of knives and
kettles and hatchets."</p>

<p>On a subsequent occasion, a third as many again of these
implements were taken as cargo.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Ships besieged
by peddlers.</p>

<p>In the meantime, it was not to be supposed that the rumours
of the great value put upon petty merchandise by the hyperborean
savages, could fail to excite the cupidity
of London merchants and dealers in these
things. The ships that sailed in the spring of
1671 were besieged by peddlers and small dealers, who were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
prepared to adventure their property in the wilds. Not only
the ships, but the houses selected for the Company's meetings
were beset with eager throngs, praying the adventurers, collectively
and individually, to act as middlemen for their trumpery
merchandise.</p>

<p>Not only did the ships and the place of meeting suffer
siege, but as many as thirty persons shipped out to Hudson's
Bay in the first two voyages after the granting of the charter,
while twenty-one of them returned in the next two vessels
fully determined, apparently, to repeat a journey which had
proved so lucrative.</p>

<p>To abate this nuisance, it was enacted that no persons
would "hereafter be employed to stay in the country or
otherwise but by consent of the Committee, nor any goods be
put aboard the ships but with their knowledge and consent,
to the end that the ships be not hereafter pestered as they
were the last voyage."</p>

<p>This enactment may have had its rise in the dishonesty of
these self-appointed adventurers. On several occasions on
unshipping the cargo, boxes and barrels containing valuable
furs would be found missing, or their loss would coincide
with the disappearance of a reprobate who had joined the
ship without a character.</p>

<p>Thus we read in the minutes that at one meeting it was
ordered that enquiry be made as to sixty beaver skins,
"very good and large, packed up with the others, in one of
the casks, which were not found." One Jeremiah Walker, a
second mate and supercargo was required to state which cask
they were taken in, and his cross-examination reveals the
loose and unbusiness-like methods then in vogue.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more entertaining than the character of
these meetings, as compared with a modern board-meeting
of a joint stock enterprise. A great air of mystery was kept
up. The novelty of the undertaking was so great as to imbue
the committee with a high sense of the importance and
interest of their weekly conclaves. The length of the
speeches bears witness to this spirit. A member had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
known to speak for a whole hour on the edifying theme as to
whether the furs should be placed in barrels or boxes.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Arms of the Hudson's Bay Company.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Vague rumours of these secret proceedings permeated the
town. They became a standing topic at the places where
men foregathered. To the popular imagination, the north
was a land of fable. The denizens of those countries were
invested with strange attributes and clothed in weird and
wonderful garments. The Hudson's Bay Company dealt with
picturesque monarchs and a fierce, proud and noble people,
whose ordinary attire was the furs of sable, of ermine, of
fox, and of otter; who made treaties and exacted tributes
after the fashion of the ceremonial East. Petty chiefs and
sachems were described as kings and emperors; the wretched
squaws of a redskin leader as queens. It was, perhaps, only
natural for a generation which banqueted its imagination on
the seductive fable of a North-West Passage to confuse
the Red Indians of North America with the inhabitants of
the East; a very long period was to pass away before the
masses were able to distinguish between the tawny-skinned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Indian of the North American continent and the swarthy
servants of the East India Company. Nor were the masses
alone sinners in this respect. The Indians of Dryden,
of Congreve, of Steele, and even of writers so late as
Goldsmith no more resembled the real Red-men than the
bison of the western prairies was akin to the buffalo of the
Himalayas.</p>

<p>For such reasons as these, the Adventurers kept their
ways and their superior knowledge with superior discretion
to themselves.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Capital of the
Company.</p>

<p>It was never known in the seventeenth century what
actually constituted the original capital of the Adventurers.
So small was it that when, in the course of the
Parliamentary Committee of Enquiry in 1749,
nearly eighty years after the Company had
received its charter, the figures were divulged, the pettiness of
the sum occasioned universal surprise. Each adventurer was
apparently required to pay £300, sterling; and the gross
sum was divided into thirty-four equal shares. Besides Prince
Rupert's "sundry charges" (the euphemism employed to
describe the sum paid him for his interest in obtaining the
charter), his Highness was offered a share amounting to
one equal share. "He having graciously signified his
acceptance thereof," says the secretary in the minute-book,
"credit given him for three hundred pounds." The capital
thus stood at £10,500.

Distrust of Radisson&mdash;Expedition to Moose River&mdash;Groseilliers
and the Savages&mdash;The Bushrangers Leave the Company's Service&mdash;Arrival

</p>

<p>While the Honourable Company of Adventurers was holding
its meetings in Mr. Alderman Horth's house, and gravely
discussing its huge profits and its motley wares, an event was
happening some thousands of miles away which was to decide
the fate, for some years at least, of the two picturesque figures
to whom the inception of the whole enterprise was due.</p>

<p>In August, 1671, M. Talon, the Intendant of New France,
sent for a certain Father Albanel and a young friend of
his, the Sieur de St. Simon, and after embracing them sent
both forth on a perilous mission to the North. They were
directed to "penetrate as far as the Mer du Nord; to draw
up a memoir of all they would discover, drive a trade in
fur with the Indians, and especially reconnoitre whether there
be any means of wintering ships in that quarter." Such were
the injunctions bestowed upon these hardy spirits on the
eve of their errand. To recur to a theme already touched
upon, if the French Government of the day had previously
caused visits to be made to Hudson's Bay in the manner
described several years later, all this knowledge would have
been already acquired; and there would have been no
necessity to despatch either priest or layman thither to make
that discovery anew.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Father
Albanel's
journey.</p>

<p>In the "Jesuit Relations" for 1672 is found Father
Albanel's own narration of his journey:</p>

<p>"Hitherto this voyage had been considered impossible
for Frenchmen, who, after having undertaken
it three times and not having been able to
surmount the obstacles, had seen themselves
to abandon it in despair of success. What
appears as impossible is found not to be so when it pleases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
God. The conduct of it was reserved to me after eighteen
years' prosecution that I had made, and I have very excellent
proofs that God reserved the execution of it for me, after
the singular favour of a sudden and marvellous, not to say
miraculous, recovery that I received as soon as I devoted
myself to this mission at the solicitation of my Superior;
and in fact I have not been deceived in my expectation; I
have opened the road, in company with two Frenchmen and
six savages." Thus it is made apparent that so far as the
Jesuits, pioneers of this country, were concerned, no knowledge
of any of their compatriots having penetrated to
Hudson's Bay had ever reached them. The letter that M.
Talon was writing to his royal master is proof that he, too,
was unaware of any prior discovery. No doubt remains that
the worthy priest and the young chevalier, his servant, were
the first party travelling overland from Quebec to penetrate
into those regions and to behold that vast expanse of water.</p>

<p>The little band of English at Fort Charles, under Charles
Bailey, who had been sent out as Governor of Rupert's Land
by the Company, were soon made aware of the proximity of
the French, and no one seems to have been more affected by
the news than Radisson and Groseilliers. The two brothers-in-law
indulged in many anxious surmises. Radisson offered
to go and find out who the intruders were, but the Governor
by no means favoured the idea. In those days, when national
rivalries and prejudices were so intense, and especially so
among the English middle classes, Bailey seems to have felt
a great deal of distrust with regard to the two Frenchmen;
and he early made up his mind to let them know his opinion
and feel his authority. The two parties were continually at
loggerheads; the Frenchmen naturally resenting the Governor's
unjust suspicions, and the Governor retorting by a
ponderous irony and a surly and continual surveillance of
their speech and movements.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rivals on
the scene.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1673, the occupants of the Company's
post, at Rupert's River, were made aware of the
neighbourhood of their trade rivals in no pleasant manner.
The Indians of the country round about began to show signs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
of disaffection. On being questioned, some of the more
friendly ones were induced to betray the cause. They had
been informed by the Frenchmen, who in
that and the previous years had reached the
shores of the Bay, distant some twenty or
thirty leagues, that the English were not to be trusted,
that their firearms were bewitched, and their religion was
that of the evil one. Peaceably inclined, the Nodwayes,
who were the principal inhabitants of that region, fell an
easy prey to the proselytism of the indomitable Jesuits,
and many of their younger braves had journeyed to
Quebec and taken part in the mission services there, and
at Montreal, before the arrival of Dablon in their midst.
But they were readily adaptable to the racial and commercial
antagonisms of their teachers; and late in 1673
Governor Bailey was informed that they contemplated an
attack on the fort.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0081" id="im_0081"></a>
<img src="images/im_0081.jpg" width="403" height="236" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Type of Early Trading Post.</span><br />
(<i>From an old print.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>On this, the Company's servants began the task of strengthening
their frail defences. The Governor alleged that he had
received instructions from England to despatch Groseilliers
to the other side of the Bay, called the "West Main."
Radisson sought to accompany his kinsman, but was met
with a peremptory refusal. This action by no means increased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
the amity between him and his rather stupid and
choleric superior. Nevertheless the winter passed without
any open exhibition of hostility between the two men; and it
seemed likely that no difficulties would arise while the cold
weather continued. The ground was, however, still covered
with snow when several Indians appeared and asked to be
allowed to take up their abode at the east end of the fort,
that they might be ready for trade in the spring. Bailey,
with his customary sagacity in such matters, suspected some
treachery in this; but on the active expostulations of
Radisson the simple request was granted, and the Indians
immediately proceeded to erect their wigwams. On the 25th
of March, when the thaw commenced, six savages, announcing
themselves as ambassadors from Kas-Kidi-dah, the chief of
the tribe, (referred to by Bailey's secretary as "King Cusciddidah,")
came to herald the approach of that potentate. It
so chanced that both the Governor and Radisson were absent,
having gone out to reconnoitre and to obtain an addition to
their now slender stock of meat. In all these little expeditions
the Governor and Radisson were inseparable. The
former swore privately he could never bring
himself to trust the fort in the hands of a
Frenchman; and, although there was no reason
whatever to apprehend such consequences, the
Governor constantly acted as if any such show of confidence
on his part would emphatically jeopardize the
interests of the Company.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Governor
Bailey's
distrust.</p>

<p>King Cusciddidah arrived on the following day. "His
Majestie brought a retinue with him," records Thomas Gorst,
the Governor's secretary, "but very little beaver, the Indians
having already sent their best to Canada."</p>

<p>In the absence of the Governor, the occupants of the fort
regarded Captain Cole as their superior. Cole did not place
much confidence in the pacific mien of the savages surrounding
the fort, and a guard was kept up night and day. Under
cover of darkness two sailors were despatched to find the
Governor; but scarcely had they departed on their quest
than Cusciddidah proposed that two of his Indians should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
go on the same errand. The acting commandant of the
fort could not well decline this offer, and on the 31st of
March the second party returned, bringing with them the
Governor. To the surprise of all Radisson did not accompany
him. No explanation was offered; but the next day the
rumour ran that they had quarrelled in the wilderness, that
from words they came to blows, and that finally Radisson
had attempted to shoot the Governor.</p>

<p>Filled with a natural alarm, Groseilliers made several
attempts to obtain from Bailey the true story of the affair,
but the Governor declined to affirm or confirm anything,
saying that he had no doubt Groseilliers knew quite as much
of the matter as himself. Groseilliers' anxiety, however, was
considerably lessened when at a formal conference with the
Indian king, held at the latter's wigwams near the fort, he
learnt that the French had made a settlement not above
eight days' journey from Rupert's River. Hither, in effect,
Radisson had repaired; and afterwards from thence made his
way back to Quebec. Of his subsequent adventures mention
will be made later in the narrative.</p>

<p class="sidenote">First French
rivalry.</p>

<p>Cusciddidah openly demanded the English protection. He
declared his apprehension of being attacked by other Indians,
whom the French had animated against the English and all
who dealt with them. He even gave a description of the fort
the French had erected on the banks of Moose
River, and the contents of its store-house. Already
the French were resorting to many artifices
to hinder the natives from trading with the heretic pale-faces;
they gave higher value for the furs brought them, and lost no
opportunity of instilling into the minds of the Indians a far
from flattering opinion of their trade rivals, the English.</p>

<p>One hearer received these tidings with complete equanimity.
That which surprised and confounded his companions,
filled the bosom of Chouart des Groseilliers with a secret
joy. The Governor's high-handed deportment had oppressed,
if it had not angered him; and he had, together with his
brother-in-law, begun to suspect that this policy of enmity
was dictated by a desire to rid himself and the Company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
of them both. But in the proximity of the French he
found a weapon of great utility in his relations with the
Governor, his superior officer.</p>

<p>On the third of April a council was held, to debate upon
the advisability of the Company's agents removing from
Rupert's to Moose River, thus to prevent their traffic
being intercepted by the French. The Governor adopted a
tone of great cordiality towards Groseilliers, and listened
with deference to his advice. Groseilliers boldly counselled
giving up the present fort and establishing themselves close
to the French. Bailey, much to Captain Cole's astonishment,
instantly approved of the plan. In vain did Cole
protest against the course as dangerous; the Governor
professed his confidence in Groseilliers' wisdom, and ordered
the sloop to be got ready for the journey.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0084" id="im_0084"></a>
<img src="images/im_0084.jpg" width="393" height="256" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bark Canoe of Indians on Hudson's Bay.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In the meantime the Indians in the neighbourhood of
Fort Charles continued building their wigwams. They
raised their wauscohegein or fort so near the English that
the palisades joined. As their numbers increased, Groseilliers
advised putting off their own expedition until the savages
were gone hunting, so that Fort Charles and those left in
charge might not be surprised in their absence. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
20th of May, seven canoes containing more subjects of
Cusciddidah arrived, bringing the news to the English that
few, if any, Upland Indians might be expected to visit
them that season, the French having persuaded them to
journey with their goods to Canada instead. Indeed, said
they, the tribes had already left, so that even if the
English expedition were made, it would be fruitless.</p>

<p>At this depressing intelligence Bailey again sought Groseilliers'
advice, and this being still in favour of advancing
to Moose River, it was adopted. Before the departure, on
the 27th of May, a band of about fifty men, women and
children appeared, anxious to trade; but instead of furs they
offered wampum, feathers, and a few small canoes, for none
of which merchandise the Company's agents had need.
They were of the nation called Pishapocanoes, a tribe allied
to the Esquimaux, and like them, a "poor, beggarly people;
by which," adds one of the party, "we may perceive the
French ran away with the best of the trade."</p>

<p>Everything being now in readiness, the expedition started,
but without Bailey. The Governor, at the last moment,
decided to remain behind at Fort Charles and await their
return.</p>

<p class="sidenote">First visit to
Moose River.</p>

<p>The voyage across the Bay was made in safety, and on
the very day of landing at the mouth of Moose River, a
band of Tabiti Indians were encountered, from
whom they obtained about two hundred pelts.
The chief of this band denied that the French
had bribed them or the other Indians not to trade with the
English. They declared that as yet their intercourse had
been almost entirely with the Jesuits, one of whom was
Father Albanel, who had merely urged them to live on terms
of friendship with the nations in league with the French.
The chief blamed the English for trading with such pitiful
tribes as Cusciddidah's and the Pishapocanoes, advising them
instead to settle at Moose River, where, he asserted, the
Upland Indians would come and trade with them.</p>

<p>One curious incident occurred in the course of this parley.
The Tabiti chief, who had been for some time looking rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
sharply at Groseilliers, suddenly broke off the intercourse.
When Captain Cole demanded the reason, the chief declared
that it was on Groseilliers' account, whom he had recognized
as the Frenchman with whom he had had dealings many
years before. Groseilliers, nothing loth, stepped forward, and
declared that the chief might possess himself in easiness
on that score, as he was now to all intents and purposes
an Englishman; and that he would always trade with the
Tabitis as such.</p>

<p>"But you drove hard bargains," returned the chief. "You
took our silkiest, softest and richest furs, and you gave us but
beads and ribbons. You told us the skins of the sable, and
marten, and beaver were of little account to you, whereas the
English give us, and the French traders as well, guns and
hatchets in exchange."</p>

<p>This harangue does not seem to have particularly disconcerted
Groseilliers; he was an old Indian trader; he returned
a polite answer, renewing his expressions of amity. Nevertheless,
it made a profound impression upon the other members
of the party, who reported to Bailey on their return that the
Indians thought Groseilliers too hard on them, and refused to
deal with him. Indeed, they did not scruple to assert that
the comparative failure of their expedition was owing to
Groseilliers' presence; that both the Tabitis and the Shechittiwans,
hard by, were really possessed of peltries which they
chose to conceal.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bailey at
Moose River.</p>

<p>On hearing this intelligence, Bailey himself was induced
to set out for Moose River. By rare good fortune, he found
the Tabitis reinforced by a numerous band of
Shechittiwans, who had journeyed thither some
fifty leagues and were eager to trade. From this
tribe, the Governor procured no fewer than fifteen hundred
skins on very good terms. Charmed with his adventure, he
decided to pursue his course, discover the Chechouan River,
and thence coast along the west shore of the Bay, to Port
Nelson, where there was, as yet, no fort.</p>

<p>On the 18th of July, he arrived at Chechouan River, "where
no Englishman had been before," but secured little or no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
beaver. He treated with the chief of the tribe he found
there and with his son, who exacted from him a promise that
he would come with a ship and trade the next year. In
return, they assured him they would provide a quantity of
beaver and induce the Upland tribes to travel thence. Hardly
had the sloop departed than, on the 27th, it ran upon a
mass of floating ice and narrowly escaped foundering. This
catastrophe precipitated the Governor's return to Rupert's
River. He arrived to find Groseilliers and his protégé Gorst
at daggers drawn, and the factors, traders and sailors almost
at the point of mutiny, and all this because they objected to
serve under a Frenchman.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Jesuit priest
at
Fort Charles.</p>

<p>Bailey now seems to have made up his mind what course
to pursue with regard to Groseilliers; but if anything were
wanting to complete his decision, he had not long to wait.
On the next day but one, that is to say the 30th
of August, a messenger came to him to announce
the arrival of a canoe. In it was a Jesuit missionary,
accompanied by one of Cusciddidah's own
sons. The worthy priest was in a sorry condition with regard
to his apparel, most of which he had either been robbed of or
been compelled to barter for food during his long sojourn in
the wilderness. He had left Quebec during the preceding
October, but had been detained for many months owing to
the impassability of the route. He bore with him letters;
one of them for Mr. Bailey from the Governor of Quebec.
This epistle seems to have given Bailey a great deal of pleasure,
and as a communication from one great man to another,
he caused it to be publicly read out in the fort. The French
Governor desired Bailey to treat the priest civilly "on account
of the amity between the two crowns"; and the bearer of this
letter had no reason to complain of a lack of hospitality. He
was clothed and entertained with great kindness.</p>

<p>Unhappily, on the very evening of his arrival, the Governor
was made aware that the Jesuit had brought other letters, and
that these had been delivered into the hands of Groseilliers.
Always suspicious, he now became convinced of treachery.
He saw in this harmless visit of a pious missionary a deep-laid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
plot to capture the fort and allow it to be pillaged by the hostile
Indians. He ordered Groseilliers to appear before him. But
Groseilliers was not to be found, and Gorst returned to say
that both the Frenchmen were out walking together. Bailey,
taking several men with him, now went himself in search
of the pair; he confronted Groseilliers, and hurled a host of
accusations at his head. To these accusations, all ill-founded
and ill-advised, Groseilliers very promptly responded by
knocking the Governor down. He then returned calmly to
the fort, demanded his wages and possessions, and calling
three of the Indians to his side, including the young brave
who had accompanied the priest, set off valiantly into the
wilderness. In due time he reached Quebec, where he rendered
a faithful account to the authorities of what had transpired.
He also forwarded to England, by way of New
England, a minute account of his experiences, which was
duly read out at one of the meetings of the Company.</p>

<p>The Jesuit, who had offered to proceed with Groseilliers,
had been detained. He seems to have made himself very
useful to the English in their dealings with the Indians,
although he was thoroughly distrusted, as was to be expected,
by the Governor.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Arrival of
the "Prince
Rupert."</p>

<p>On the 24th of September, a sloop was descried in the
river, which, with joy, they soon made out to be the <i>Prince
Rupert</i>, just arrived from England. She was commanded by
Captain Gillam, and with her came the new
Governor, William Lyddal, to supersede Bailey.
Captain Gillam reported that the sister-ship, the
<i>Shaftesbury</i>, commanded by Captain Shepherd,
was likewise at the mouth of the river. The new Governor's
commission and instructions being read, all hands were
immediately put to work, with the intention of unloading
and reloading the ships for the return voyage immediately.
Bailey seems to have expressed the greatest anxiety to proceed
to London without delay; but at length he was induced
to listen to reason. It was pointed out to him that the season
would be far spent before the work of equipment could be
properly concluded. After several councils, it was resolved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
that they should winter at Rupert's River; and no effort was
made to unload the vessels until the following spring. In the
meantime, the crews were not idle. Under Lyddal's direction
they found employment in cutting timber and building
houses, more particularly a bake-house and a brew-house,
which latter added greatly to the comfort of the fort.</p>

</p>

<p>Rapidly advancing in prosperity and reputation, and possessed
of a basis of credit which gave it a welcome sense of
solidity, the Company now renewed its efforts to extend its
trade and settlements. The weekly meetings in Mr. John
Horth's house, which were so full of mystery to the public,
continued to bear fruit; and at length a regular system was
determined for the organization and government of its distant
dependencies.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Ignorance of
the geography
of Hudson's
Bay.</p>

<p>All ships bound for Hudson's Bay were now ordered to
visit Charlton Island, which lies about forty miles from the
mouth of Rupert's River, in the extreme south of the Bay;
and the island was also made a rendezvous whither all factors
were to bring all their merchandise for the purpose of loading
the Company's ships. The geography of the district had
hitherto, in spite of the researches of a long series of
explorers, beginning with Frobisher, and ending with Fox,
remained obscure. But the Company's servants had not been
idle, and the Adventurers were soon in possession
of carefully drawn charts, and maps of the
straits, the Bay itself, and the lands surrounding
it. They kept themselves also well-advised by
lists, drawings, and detailed descriptions, of the
tribes inhabiting the territories granted to them under the
charter; and the discussions which went on over this subject
were not lacking in humour. It is worth observing that for a
great many years during the early history of the Company,
its Governors, captains, chief factors, chief traders, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
rank and file of its employees could never by any chance
agree, either as to the number or the characteristics of the
aborigines. In concocting their reports many were animated
purely by love of romance: others relied too implicitly on the
tales told by the Indians themselves; others may be credited
with being the victims of their own imaginations. Nor could
the lists enumerating the tribes boast more consistency.
Extracts from those of two governors may be given here
for purposes of comparison:&mdash;</p>

<p>No wonder, therefore, that the Adventurers in England
were puzzled, and that at one of their later meetings Prince
Rupert was forced to exclaim:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, these Indians" (each member had been supplied
with Governor Nixon's list) "are not our Indians.
'Fore God, out of the nineteen I see only five we have dealt
with before."</p>

<p>Another worthy member declared, on a similar occasion
that the tribes frequenting the Bay were more volatile than
the Bedouins. "These are not men, but chameleons"&mdash;was
the remark of another adventurer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Confusion of
tribes.</p>

<p>The chief cause of the confusion lay in the variations of
spelling. More than a century was to elapse before a
common orthography was adopted, and in the
interval it was impossible to fix the tribes by
name with certainty. The name of no tribe
perhaps underwent such vicissitudes of spelling and pronunciation
as that described by the earliest Jesuit pioneers as the
Ossa-poiles, which in our own day are known as the Assiniboines.
They were in process of time the Poeles, Poets,
the Pedlas, the Semplars, Oss-Semplars, Essapoils and the
Simpoils.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>At a general court held to consider the action of Governor
Bailey, the majority of the adventurers professed themselves
rejoiced at having been quit of the services of the Sieurs
Groseilliers and Radisson; yet there were not wanting others
to openly regret the treatment these two men had received.
As may be supposed, the most fervent of their advocates and
defenders was Sir John Kirke, whose daughter had married
Radisson, and who himself had lately been knighted by the
king. He predicted some disaster to the Company from
having dismissed these two faithful servants, and he was loud
and persistent in asserting the bad faith and unjust suspicions
of Bailey.</p>

<p>While the affairs of the Company were proceeding tranquilly
at home, the conduct and employment of one of these
two bushrangers was more enlivening. Chouart was passing
his time in inactivity at Three Rivers. But his brother-in-law,
after several ineffectual endeavours to establish a northern
rivalry to the Company, had offered his services to the French
Navy. This career, which at that period must have been,
even for him, sufficiently eventful and exciting, was cut short
by ship-wreck in 1679. Losing all his property, even to his
clothing, Radisson made his way first to Brest and then to
Paris. The Vice-Admiral and Intendant of the Fleet having
written in his favour, the Court was pleased to grant him a
sum of one hundred crowns, and hope was also held out to
him that he would be honoured by the command of a frigate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
In the meantime he was accorded leave to go to England to
fetch his wife.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Radisson in
France.</p>

<p>Madame Radisson, otherwise Mistress Mary Kirke, appears
to have caused her husband a great deal of mortification
and numerous disappointments. There is no doubt that her
continued residence in England, in spite of her
husband's return to the French service, made
him an object of suspicion to the French Court.
Once when he endeavoured, in a memorable interview with
Colbert, to press upon that Minister his scheme for ousting
the English from Hudson's Bay, the Minister responded
coldly:</p>

<p>"M. Radisson, you are suspected of being in league with
the English, your father-in-law is one of the members of the
English Company; and your wife resides under his roof."</p>

<p>"I made him understand," declared Radisson long afterwards,
"that, though married, I was not master of my wife.
Her father would by no means consent to my bringing her
to France with me."</p>

<p>These rebuffs determined him to make an attempt to
better his worldly condition elsewhere. A true soldier of
fortune, patriotism appears to have had little weight with
him; he was as ready to serve under the English as
the French. He returned to find his father-in-law more
placable. Sir John had at this time certain claims against
the French; and he doubtless fancied that Radisson might
assist him in preferring these at the French Court. He
took occasion to ask his father-in-law what chance there
remained to him of again securing employment under the
Company. "None, sir," replied Kirke, "both Bailey, Lyddal
and others are against you and have poisoned the minds of
their employers. Prince Rupert is, however, your friend,
and also Captain Gillam; but one dislikes to speak openly,
and the other dare not."</p>

<p>Acting on this intelligence, Radisson resolved to see Rupert.
The prince received him kindly enough; he took pains to
show him his collection of mezzotints, and to explain some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
his scientific curiosities. He even went so far as to condole
with Radisson on the treatment he had received. But he
had to point out that the temper of the Company was such
that he feared it would be in vain for him to exercise his
interest for his visitor's reinstatement.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Plan to
dislodge the
Company.</p>

<p>Radisson, disappointed of his hopes, and frustrated in his
desire to return with his wife, did not meet with a warm welcome
on the other side of the Channel. Colbert received him
with black looks; and the suspicions which gathered about
him were now strengthened rather than dissipated. In this
extremity he repaired to the Marquis de Seignely, to whom he
set forth substantially the same plan which he
had cherished for years, of opening out the trade
of the North, with the additional attraction now
of dislodging the English from a commerce
which had already proved vastly profitable. Seignely listened
with interest, and requested time to reflect on the matter.
At the second interview Radisson was not overwhelmed with
disappointment, for he had expected no other issue; he was
told flatly that he was regarded by the king as little better
than a traitor; and that his Canadian project met with
universal distrust.</p>

<p>The outlook seemed discouraging indeed, when happily at
this juncture there arrived in Paris M. de la Chesnaye, who was
in charge of the fur-trade in Canada, as the head of the Compagnie
du Nord. This event proved Radisson's salvation.
He learned with great rejoicing that La Chesnaye's visit to
France was actuated by a desire to report upon the intrusion
of the English Company. La Chesnaye proved a true friend;
he evinced himself most heartily in favour of the Government
securing the services of Radisson in establishing a rival establishment,
on the principle of those of the Company to which
he had formerly been attached.</p>

<p>Many consultations took place, both Seignely and Chesnaye
listening with great interest while Radisson explained the
equipment and merchandise of the Hudson's Bay Company,
which he strongly advised should be taken as a pattern in all
practical extensions of the French fur-trade in those regions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Radisson
assisted by the
Jesuits.</p>

<p>The only difficulty now presenting itself was to find money
for the enterprise. The exchequer of the Court was at a
low ebb; and it had a thousand calls upon its charity and
liberality. Radisson must wait even for the few hundred
crowns he so sadly needed for his passage to New France and
his personal needs. There was, however, one force in France
which could always be approached with a good courage when
any enterprise in a new country required support, and always
with success. It was the power which, though it had endured
a thousand disappointments and sacrificed a
thousand lives, and as many fortunes, in the
attempt to teach the Gospel of Jesus in the
wilderness, had adhered without wavering to its
faith in the ultimate victory of the Cross over the savage
nature of the Indians. No adventurer, if he had but a sufficiently
plausible story, need turn away empty-handed from
the door of the Jesuits. To the Jesuits of Paris Radisson
presented himself as a good Catholic seeking to subvert the
designs of the heretic English. He applied for assistance,
and he was at length rewarded for his pains by a sum of
five hundred crowns.</p>

<p>But nearly two years had passed before this assistance was
procured. Radisson's debts had accumulated; his creditors
were clamouring about him, threatening him with the sponging-house;
no effort to elude them met with success, and at
length he found himself at Rochelle, with scarce twenty
crowns in his pocket over and above the cost of his passage.
It was then that he made the resolve to reimburse the Jesuits,
"if he should live to be worth so great a sum," and it is
interesting to discover that two years later he kept his word.
At present he could only trust to La Chesnaye, who was
anxiously awaiting his arrival in Quebec. Thither Radisson
arrived on the 25th of September, 1681.</p>

<p>La Chesnaye showed much joy at seeing his friend; for in
truth his own plans for seeking to share the northern trade of
the English were nearly ripe. He declared that there was no
time to be lost; but that in spite of the urgency of the matter
the greatest circumspection would have to be observed, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Frontenac by no means desired to compromise the king
without first seeing his way clear.</p>

<p>But if the Governor whose career was about to close was
punctilious, the Intendant Duchesneau was not. He had
already dispatched a memoir to his superior relating to
Hudson's Bay, and to what he believed to be the French
rights there.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Duchesneau
protests
against English
encroachments.</p>

<p>"They" (the English) he wrote, "are still on Hudson's
Bay on the north and do great damage to our fur-trade.
The farmers [of the revenue] suffer in consequence
by this diminution of the trade at
Tadoussac, and throughout the entire country,
because the English drive off the Outaoua
nations. For the one and the other design they
have two forts on the said Bay&mdash;the one towards
Tadoussac and the other at Cape Henrietta Marie, on the
side of the Assinibonetz. The sole means to prevent them
succeeding in what is prejudicial to us in this regard would be
to drive them by main force from that Bay, which belongs to
us. Or, if there would be an objection in coming to that
extremity, to construct forts on the rivers falling into the
lakes, in order to stop the Indians at these points."</p>

<p>The zealous Intendant declared that should King Lewis
adopt the resolution to arrange with the Duke of York for his
possessions in that quarter, "in which case Boston could not
resist," Canada would be ruined, "the French being naturally
inconsistent and fond of novelty."</p>

<p>Finding, however, that they could obtain no official recognition
of the enterprise, La Chesnaye at length resorted
to a transparent fiction in order to account for Radisson's
departure&mdash;a subterfuge which was the more necessary since
many had begun to suspect his destination and urged the
Governor to do nothing which would bring down on them the
enmity of the English and their allies, the Iroquois. He
requested the Governor, if he would not countenance an
expedition with license to trade on the shores of the Bay, to
grant Radisson formal permission to return to France by way
of New England in a vessel belonging to the Government of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Acadia, which at that moment lay in the St. Lawrence ready
to sail.</p>

<p>It was arranged privately that after his departure Radisson
should proceed in this vessel only as far as Isle Percée in
the Gulf, near the mouth of the river, and there await his
kinsmen Groseilliers, his nephew Chouart, and the two ships
which La Chesnaye was even then busily fitting out. Thus
all official cognizance of the expedition would be avoided.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Company's
enemies leave
Quebec.</p>

<p>The terms agreed upon were, that in return for La Chesnaye's
equipment, Radisson and Groseilliers were, provided
certain conditions were carried out, to receive jointly half the
profits of the venture, and La Chesnaye the other half.
What these conditions were can only be guessed; but beyond
all question, they concerned the capture or spoliation of the
English trading posts on the Bay. Radisson
took with him his nephew, Jean Baptiste,
who had passed nearly the whole of his life
among the Indians as a <i>coureur de bois</i>; the
pilot, Pierre Allemand, and an old bushranger named
Godefrey, who was well acquainted with the Indians of the
northern regions. Groseilliers was to remain behind until
the spring, when he was to have the command of the smaller
of the two vessels. On the 4th of November the advance
guard of the expedition directed against the Company's
establishment in Hudson's Bay left Quebec.</p>

<p>In the following spring the rendezvous was kept at the
island named. Radisson is found complaining bitterly of the
character of the vessels <i>St. Pierre</i> and <i>St. Anne</i>. The
former he describes as an old craft of 50 tons only, "with
twelve men of a crew, including those with me. There
were goods enough for the trade aboard her," he adds, "but
so scanty a supply of provisions that if I had not been so
deeply engaged I should not venture on the enterprise."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rejected
advice
of Radisson
and
Groseilliers.</p>

<p>If his case was scarcely hopeful, that of his brother-in-law
was far worse. The latter's vessel could boast but little more
than half the tonnage, and while her crew was larger by three
men, she carried even fewer supplies. But Radisson and
Groseilliers were not men to shrink from any enterprise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
because it seemed hazardous. They had led bold, reckless
lives, and their spirits rose at the prospect of danger. It
was afterwards alleged of this pair that one great cause of
their disagreement with the Company was their absolute
inability to remain quiet and content in the enjoyment of a
regular traffic. Such a career seemed to their
bold, energetic dispositions worthier of drapers'
apprentices. It is said they counselled the
Company not to think of establishing one or
two trading posts and expect the Indians to
come to them for trade, but to push on in the wilderness
to the north and west, building new depots and stirring
up the hunters to greater activity and more profitable
results. Had this advice been followed, the exploration
of the great North-West would not only have been anticipated
by almost a century; but by the occupation of its
territory, the great evils of a later day would have been
averted; nor would anyone in England have challenged
the Company's right to an exclusive trade in the regions
granted by its charter.</p>

<p>But the Company was soon to learn that its earliest
pioneers and forerunners were not to be cast off with impunity.
The two bushrangers experienced considerable difficulty at
the outset in propitiating and calming the fears of their
crews, who were terrified, and not without reason, at the
prospect of a voyage of 900 leagues in such craft as the
<i>St. Pierre</i> and the <i>St. Anne</i>, and amidst rough water and
ice. But they at length succeeded and effected a start.</p>

<p>After nineteen days the crew of Groseilliers' ship mutinied.
Groseilliers' attempts to appease them seemed about to end
in signal failure when the man on watch cried out that a
vessel was in sight to windward. Groseilliers seized his
opportunity; "See!" he cried, pointing to the distant barque,
"yonder is one of the English Company, laden with the
profits of their trade in the Bay. Every man has his pocket
full of gold and his stomach full of rum; and we shall have
the same if we are not cowards enough to abandon our
voyage."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>After innumerable episodes, some of which almost ended
in tragic consequences, Radisson at last, on the 26th of
August, arrived on the west coast of Hudson's Bay. On the
following day he was joined by his brother-in-law in the <i>St.
Anne</i> at the mouth of a river named by the Indians Ka-kirka-kiouay,
translated by Radisson as "who goes, who comes."</p>

<p>Twelve days before their arrival another ship had entered
this same river, commanded by none other than Captain
Gillam, and having on board John Bridgar, commissioned as
Governor of the new settlement at Port Nelson.</p>

<p>Having thus entered the river, they advanced fifteen miles
up stream, and Radisson then left Groseilliers to build a
fort, while he himself departed in search of savages with
whom to trade. With him he took his nephew and Godefrey,
all three being well armed with muskets and pistols. In the
course of eight days they accomplished forty leagues and
attained the upper part of the river, though without meeting
a single savage. On the eighth day, however, their
eyes were rejoiced by the sight of a large encampment of
Indians, who, while not especially rich in furs, were eager to
conclude a treaty with the French, and to encourage their
settlement in the country. Radisson now decided to return,
accompanied by some of the savages, and on the 12th day
of September rejoined his brother-in-law, whose fort he found
pretty well advanced.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The younger
Gillam
discovered.</p>

<p>Hardly had he returned when the sudden booming of a
cannon startled the settlement. It was the first time the
Indians had ever heard the sound, and they expressed much
astonishment and apprehension. While the two adventurers
hastened to re-assure their allies, they were themselves
hardly less disturbed. Radisson made up his mind
to immediately ascertain whence the firing came and with
this intention he embarked in a canoe and went
to the mouth of the river. In passing to the
opposite bank of the stream, and while in the
vicinity of a small island, they perceived signs
of European habitation. A tent had been erected, and at that
moment a log house was being built. After a stealthy reconnoitre,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
lasting the whole night, Radisson and his companions
advanced boldly in the morning from the opposite shore in
their canoe. The islanders were engaged in making a repast
when Radisson attracted their attention. Speaking first to
them in French, and finding that none of them understood,
he thereupon addressed them in English. He asked them
what was their business in those parts.</p>

<p>Their leader quickly responded: "We are English, and
come for the beaver trade."</p>

<p>"By whose authority," asked Radisson; "do you possess a
commission?" The other replied that he did not himself
possess such a document, but that his father did, and that he
and his companions hailed from New England. Whereupon
Radisson, still seated in his canoe at some distance from the
shore, informed them that they had not a shadow of right to
be in those regions, which he himself had discovered and
settled for the French some years before. He drew upon his
imagination so far as to intimate that he was at that moment
in command of a large force of Frenchmen near at hand, who
would effectually maintain the sovereignty of King Lewis and
his exclusive trading right in this territory; and he concluded
his harangue, which was delivered almost at the top of his
voice, by advising the party of New Englanders to embark as
soon as possible and to return from whence they came.</p>

<p>Before any reply could be made, a cry broke from the lips
of both the leaders. The canoe had touched the bank, and
they recognized one another. The New Englander was the
son of Radisson's old friend Gillam; and, as may be supposed,
he possessed a very high admiration for a man of
whom he had heard so much. They speedily embraced, but
Radisson is careful to inform us that he did not entirely trust
his young friend. When young Gillam's ship appeared at the
mouth of the river, and he was invited to go on board, he did
so, but he took the precaution of insisting upon two Englishmen
being left as hostages on shore. It was not without
misgivings that, as he neared the vessel in their canoe, he
observed the captain posting the English emblem and likewise
discharging a number of cannon shots.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>"I told him," says Radisson, "that it was not necessary
to fire any more, for fear of causing jealousy amongst our
people, who might show themselves hostile. He proposed
that we should negotiate together. I promised that I would
persuade our other officers to consent that, since the season
was already too far advanced for them to withdraw, he
should pass the winter where he was without their doing
him any mischief."</p>

<p>In short Radisson was resolved at all costs to keep up
appearances. He even went so far as to grant Gillam formal
permission to continue building his house, "barring fortifications,"
and to guarantee him against insults from the
Indians, over whom he professed to have absolute power.
The two men parted on good terms; and perhaps Gillam's
complaisance was well-advised. Radisson confesses that had
the English shown themselves refractory or exhibited any
disposition to assert rights over the country, it was his firm
intention to concert a plan for seizing their ship, which he
observes, was an "excellent prize" inasmuch it held no
commission or warrant to trade from any power.</p>

<p>It afterwards appeared that this enterprise of the New
England ship was set on foot by Gillam senior, who, dissatisfied
with his profits under the Company, sought to
adventure an expedition on his own account from Boston.
He was destined to pay the penalty for this indiscretion.</p>

<p>Happy at having come out of this encounter so easily,
Radisson and his party re-embarked in their canoe and struck
out northwards. Another surprise was in store for them. A
ship under full sail was on the point of entering the river.
More strategy was necessary. The party regained the shore
and instantly kindled a huge bonfire, upon which they cast
grass and leaves so as to produce a thick column of smoke.
Their purpose was to attract the attention and arrest the
progress of the vessel and in this they succeeded. Believing
they had come upon an Indian settlement, and anxious to
reconnoitre before proceeding farther, the parties aboard the
ship cast anchor immediately and so remained motionless in
the channel all night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Arrival of
Bridgar.</p>

<p>Early in the morning they saw that a boat was being
lowered from the ship, and while it was filling
with occupants Radisson made ready to receive
them. Each of his party was posted, armed, at
the entrance to the wood, while Radisson himself walked
down to the shore to greet the strangers.</p>

<p>They were soon within hail. Radisson set up a loud cry,
Indian fashion, for the purpose of eliciting a response. He
was disappointed in this; for the boat approached steadily
and silently; there was a movement of the oars, but most
of the figures appeared stern and motionless. The boat
grounded ten yards from where Radisson stood with folded
arms, and a general attitude of defiance. One of the crew
had got a leg over the side of the boat when our bushranger
cried out in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"Hold, in the King's name." And then presenting his
carbine, "I forbid you to land."</p>

<p>The occupants of the boat were astonished.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" they asked, "and what is your business?"</p>

<p>"I am a Frenchman," was the answer, delivered in English;
"and I hold this country for his Most Christian Majesty,
King Lewis!"</p>

<p>Radisson signalled to his followers, who emerged from their
retreat, making a brave show of their weapons. The coup
seemed destined to be successful. The leader of the boat
party, visibly impressed, remained standing up in his craft
without any attempt on the part of his followers to land.</p>

<p>"I beg to inform you, gentlemen, that we hail from London.
Our ship yonder is the <i>Prince Rupert</i>, belonging to the
honourable Hudson's Bay Company and commanded by
Captain Zachary Gillam."</p>

<p>"You arrive too late. This country is already in the
possession of the King of France, and its trade belongs to
the Northern Company of Canada."</p>

<p>A short dispute succeeded. Suddenly changing his tactics,
Governor Bridgar, for it was no other, feigned acquiescence,
admitted that after all Radisson might be right, and requested
the privilege of landing and saluting him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">The
Bushranger's
mendacity.</p>

<p>The two leaders now conversed amicably. Radisson
took occasion to elaborate the narrative to which he had
recently treated young Gillam, without, however, mentioning
the circumstance of his having met the latter. He did
not scruple to allege a lengthy residence in the region,
detailing his forces, both French and Indian, with a fine
display of exactitude. Commenced on shore, the interview
was transferred to the ship; Radisson, while accepting
Bridgar's hospitality, took care to keep, as before, two or
three hostages on land. On board the <i>Prince Rupert</i> he
embraced Gillam, and listened with a real interest to the tidings
he had to convey of what had been happening in Europe,
and of the affairs of the Company. For himself,
he readily volunteered the information that he
and his brother-in-law Groseilliers had two fine
large vessels in the vicinity, while the third was
shortly expected. He likewise made no secret of the fact
that a huge fort was being constructed hard by in the
interests of the French Company. In all of these statements
Governor Bridgar professed absolute credence, whatever may
have been his private opinion of their value.</p>

<p>In reality, however, he was not deceived; and if it had
not been for Radisson's precaution as to the hostages, there
is some reason to believe he would have detained his guest on
board the Company's ship to ruminate for a while on his
treachery to the Company. Even allowing for the truth of
Radisson's assertions regarding the occupation by the French
of Port Nelson and the surrounding neighbourhood in large
numbers, Bridgar was not to be dissuaded by mere words
from his intention to establish a factory there. He had
every confidence in the Company's rights; and he determined
to carry out his instructions to the letter.</p>

<p>No sooner had Radisson departed, therefore, than a
majority of the people on board the <i>Prince Rupert</i> landed
and commenced building a fort.</p>

<p>The French party hiding in the woods spied on their
movements; and before rejoining their comrades at their
own settlement they had the privilege of seeing the erection
of Fort Nelson, the fourth establishment of the Company
in the Hudson's Bay territories, well under way.

<p class="sidenote">Death of
Prince Rupert.</p>

<p>On the 28th of November, 1682, at his house in Spring
Garden, died the first Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company.
The prince had been in ill-health for some time, he
was in his sixty-third year; and he had lived a stirring
and adventurous life. His demise occasioned general regret,
more amongst the people than at Court; for, as
a writer of that day observed, "he had of late
years proved a faithful counsellor to the King,
but a greater patriot to English liberty; and therefore was
towards his latter end neglected by the Court to that
degree that nothing passed between him and his great
relations but bare civilities in the common forms." On
the sixth of the ensuing month his body was privately interred
among others of the Royal Family in a vault in
Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>A week later there was held a General Court of the Company,
at which the Duke of York was chosen to succeed
Rupert in the governorship. Besides the Duke himself,
his Royal Highness the Duke of Albemarle, Lord Arlington
and Mr. Hays, all delivered enthusiastic panegyrics on
the deceased prince, rightly attributing to his zeal, judgment
and enterprise, the successful establishment of the Company.
And the meeting then adjourned out of regret for the dead
Governor without proceeding to further business.</p>

<p>More than fifteen years had elapsed since Medard Chouart
des Groseilliers had first fired Prince Rupert with his project
of founding a great fur-traffic in the unknown and unexplored
regions of the New World. The prince had lived to
see that project succeed even beyond his most sanguine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
expectations. Now, at his death, the Company owned four
ships; and after all the cost of its plant, its ships and its
equipment had been paid, it was returning an annual profit of
two hundred per cent. on its capital. It was well-known that
his Highness favoured greater activity, and one of his last
acts had been to sign the commission of John Bridgar as
Governor of the new settlement at Port Nelson. But during
his own Governorship, the Company, feeling, no doubt, that
they must balance the Prince's zeal for adventure with considerable
caution, opposed the policy of rapid expansion
with somewhat excessive prudence; and it was only after
his death that they felt confident in pursuing a more vigorous
and enterprising plan of commerce.</p>

<p>Under date of April 27th, 1683, while the drama between
the French and English was being enacted at Port Nelson,
the following instructions were addressed to Governor Sargeant,
regarding trade with the interior: "You are to choose out
from amongst our servants such as are best qualified with
strength of body and the country language to travel and to
penetrate into the country, and to draw down the Indians
by fair and gentle means to trade with us."</p>

<p>But the Company was to learn that the parsimony which
then characterized its policy was not calculated to foster the
success of its aims. The majority of the men it sent out
from England could not be classified under the head of
adventurous spirits, ready to dare all for mere excitement and
the prospect of gain. They were for the most part young
men gifted with no more aptitude for the work in the wilderness
than a disinclination to pursue their callings at home.
No small number were dissatisfied apprentices; one William
Evans had been a drawer at the Rainbow Inn; Portman had
sent his scullion.</p>

<p>Even at that early day the staffs employed on the plantations
were recruited from amongst the very class least
competent to exploit those regions. The majority of the
applicants for employment in the Company's service in the
seventeenth century were not men of character and vigour, or
even of robust physique, but rather hare-brained artisans of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
the wild, dare-devil type, whose parents and friends foresaw
for them, if London or Bristol formed the sphere of their
talents, a legal and violent rather than a natural termination
of their respective careers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Company's
encouragement
requested.</p>

<p>Sargeant's response to the foregoing injunction certainly
served to enlighten his superiors. "I shall not be neglectful,"
he wrote, "as soon as I can find any man
capable and willing to send up into the country
with the Indians, to endeavour to penetrate into
what the country will and may produce, and to
effect their utmost in bringing down the Indians
to our factory; but your Honours should give good encouragement
to those who undertake such extraordinary service;
or else I fear that there will be but few that will embrace such
employment."</p>

<p>The rebuke may have been just; but it seems to have given
offence to some of the more pompous members of the Company;
and Sargeant was desired not to cast any further
reflection on his employers in his communications to them.
Nevertheless, the Company was soon to learn the value of
a less niggardly policy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile for ten days the two ex-employees, Radisson
and Groseilliers, gave no further evidence to the English at the
new settlement on Nelson River of their presence. But on
the tenth day their curiosity and uneasiness regarding the
conduct of the English Governor, Bridgar, and the other
servants of the Company, had reached such a pitch that it
was decided without further consideration that Radisson
should start off at once to reconnoitre their behaviour. The
actual distance between Fort Bourbon, on the Hays River,
and the Company's factory on Nelson River was not above
fifty miles; but owing to the dangerous character of the
river, and the necessity for delay before an attempt could be
made to cross it, Radisson and his party consumed fourteen
days on the journey.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bridgar's
credulity.</p>

<p>On their arrival on the 3rd of February, one of the first
objects to attract their attention was the <i>Prince Rupert</i>, stuck
fast in the ice and mud about a mile from where the factory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
was being erected. At the same time they met the Governor,
who was out on a hunting expedition with the chief mate of
the vessel. Satisfying himself that no treachery was intended,
Radisson accepted Bridgar's invitation to enter the log-house
which he had caused to be built for his own occupation.
Radisson introduced one of the Frenchmen who accompanied
him as the captain of an imaginary ship, which
he averred had arrived from France in his
behalf. "Mr. B. believed it and anything else
I chose to tell him," remarks Radisson naively, "I aiming
always to prevent him from having any knowledge of the
English interloper." While engaged in the pleasing diversion
of drinking each other's health, a number of musket shots
were fired. The crew of the vessel not taking any notice
of this, the bushranger concluded that those on board were
not on their guard and might readily be surprised.</p>

<p>With this condition uppermost in his mind, the Frenchman
quitted Bridgar, having first allayed any suspicion which might
have naturally arisen as to the intention of the party. The
latter went boldly on board the ship, and no hindrance being
offered, their leader had a colloquy with Captain Gillam.
The latter, while he received the visit civilly enough,
found occasion to let Radisson know that he was far from
entirely trusting him. When his visitor suggested that he
was running a great risk in allowing the <i>Prince Rupert</i> to
remain grounded, Gillam bluntly requested Radisson to mind
his own business, adding that he knew perfectly well what he
was doing&mdash;a boast which, as the sequel showed, was certainly
not well founded. Radisson was determined not to be put
out of temper, and so run risk of spoiling his plans.</p>

<p>Winter, even in all its rigour, seems to have had no terrors
for our indomitable bushranger. For the next two months, as
we shall see, he continued to scour backwards and forwards
through the country, inspiring his followers and urging them
onward to the prosecution of a plan which was obvious to
them all. After parting from Gillam the elder, who had not
the faintest suspicion that his son was in the locality, Radisson
at once started to parley with Gillam, the younger.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>When he had regained the island which he had left, he was
instantly made aware that the New Englanders had been
considerably less idle than the Company's servants; having
completed a very creditable fort and mounted it with six
pieces of cannon. With Benjamin Gillam, our bushranger
passed off the same subterfuge with which he had hoodwinked
Zachary. He spoke fluently of his newly arrived ship and
her cargo and crew, and to cap his narrative, proceeded to
introduce her captain, who was none other than the old pilot,
Pierre Allemand, who, from the description still extant of
his appearance, looked every inch the bold, fierce and uncompromising
mariner. He had a great deal to tell Benjamin
likewise of the Company's post near by, which he said
contained forty soldiers.</p>

<p>"Let them be forty devils," exclaimed Gillam, junior, "we
have built a good fort and are afraid of nothing."</p>

<p>Whereupon Radisson gently reminded him that according
to his agreement he was to have built no fort whatever. In
reply to this Benjamin begged his visitor not to take umbrage
at such a matter, as he never intended to dispute the rights of
the French in the region; and the fort was merely intended
as a defence against the Indians.</p>

<p class="sidenote">A man&oelig;uvre
of Radisson's.</p>

<p>As the evening wore on, a man&oelig;uvre suggested itself to
Radisson. He resolved to bring father and son together.
No sooner had he formed this amiable resolve
than he revealed to Benjamin Gillam the proximity
of the <i>Prince Rupert</i> and her commander,
and described the means by which an encounter might be
effected without eliciting the suspicions of Governor Bridgar
or any of the Company's servants. It consisted briefly in
young Benjamin's disguising himself as a Frenchman and a
bushranger. The scheme met with the young man's hearty
approbation and the details were settled as Radisson had
designed.</p>

<p>On the following day the party set out through the snow.
Arriving at the point of land opposite to which the Company's
ship lay, Radisson posted two of his best men in the
woods on the path which led to the factory. He instructed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
them to allow the Governor to pass should he come that way,
but that if he returned from the ship unaccompanied or prior
to their own departure they were to seize and overpower him
on the spot. With such precautions as these, Radisson felt
himself safe and went on board the <i>Prince Rupert</i> accompanied
by Gillam. He introduced his two companions into
the captain's room without any notice on the part of Gillam
the elder, and the mate and another man he had with him.
Leaning across the table, upon which was deposited a bulky
bottle of rum, Radisson whispered to the honest captain that
he had a secret of the highest importance to communicate if
he would but dismiss the others. Gillam readily sent away
the mate, but would not dismiss his second attendant until
Radisson, again in a whisper, informed him that the black-bearded
man in the strange head-gear was his son.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Meeting of
father
and son.</p>

<p>After communicating this intelligence the pair had their
own way. The next few moments were devoted to embraces
and to an interchange of news, for Captain
Gillam and Benjamin had not met for two
years. The sire could not refrain from imparting
to his son that he was running a great risk;
he declared it would be ruinous to him if it got to the
Governor's ears that there was any collusion between them.
Radisson again professed his friendship, but added that in his
opinion neither of the parties had any right to be where they
were, he having taken possession for the King of France.
"This territory is all his Most Christian Majesty's," he said.
"The fort we have built yonder we call Fort Bourbon, and
none have any right here but such as own allegiance to Lewis
XIV." He observed that nothing would cause a rupture of
the friendly relations now subsisting between French and
English but the trade in peltries, trade which he had too
great reason to fear they hoped to initiate with the Indians in
the spring.</p>

<p>The elder Gillam coolly responded that the ship he commanded,
and the spot on which they were then assembled,
luckily belonged not to himself, but to the Hudson's Bay
Company.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>"With regard to the trade, gentlemen," said he, "you have
nothing to fear from me. Even though I don't carry a solitary
beaver back to the Thames, I shall not trouble myself,
being sure of my wages."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Gillam
nearly
betrayed.</p>

<p>This interview was prolonged. The healths of the Kings of
France and England, Prince Rupert and M. Colbert (quite in
ignorance of the death of the two last named) were drunk
with zeal and enthusiasm. In the midst of all this, that which
Radisson had anticipated, occurred. Governor Bridgar, notified
of Radisson's return, came to the ship in hot haste. On
his joining the group, he remarked meaningly that the fort
the French had constructed must be nearer than he had been
given to think, since its commandant could effect so speedy
a return. He evinced himself very uneasy in
mind concerning the Frenchman's intentions.
Before their departure, young Gillam came
very near being betrayed. He was partially
recognized by one of the traders who accompanied the
Governor. But the matter passed off without serious consequences.</p>

<p>None too soon did the party return to young Gillam's fort
on the island, for a tremendous blizzard ensued, sweeping the
whole country, and forcing Radisson to remain for some days
within doors. As soon as the storm had subsided, however,
Radisson started off, declining Gillam's offer of his second
mate to accompany him back to the French settlement.</p>

<p>"I managed to dissuade him," he writes, "having my
reasons for wishing to conceal the road we should take. On
leaving we went up from the fort to the upper part of the
river, but in the evening we retraced our steps and next
morning found ourselves in sight of the sea, into which it was
necessary to enter in order to pass the point and reach the
river in which was our habitation. But everything was so
covered with ice that there was no apparent way of passing
farther. We found ourselves, indeed, so entangled in the ice
that we could neither retreat nor advance towards the shore
to make a landing. It was necessary, however, that we
should pass through the ice or perish. We remained in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
condition for four hours without being able to advance or
retire and in great danger of our lives. Our clothes were
frozen on us and we could only move with difficulty; but at
last we made so strong an attempt that we arrived at the
shore, our canoe being all broken up. Each of us took our
baggage and arms, and marched in the direction of our habitation
without finding anything to eat for three days, except
crows and birds of prey, which are the last to leave these
countries."</p>

<p>Fort Bourbon was reached at length. After reporting to
his brother-in-law all that had passed, Groseilliers was not
long in counselling what was best to be done. In his opinion
the first thing necessary was to secure possession of young
Gillam's ship. Time pressed and the spring would soon be
upon them, bringing with it the advent of the Indians. He
argued that delay might prove fatal, inasmuch as Bridgar
might at any moment learn of the presence of the New
England interlopers; and in that event he would probably
make an effort to capture their fort and add their forces to
his own. If this were done, the success of the French in
overpowering the English traders would be slight and their
voyage would have been undertaken for nothing.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Calamity
to the Company's
ship.</p>

<p>It was therefore agreed that Groseilliers should remain in
charge of the fort, while his kinsman should immediately
return to Nelson River. In a few days they parted once
more, Radisson setting out with a fresh party and thoroughly
resolved upon action. The first discovery he
made, on arriving at the scene of his proposed
operations, was that the Company's ship, the
<i>Prince Rupert</i>, was frozen fast in the ice, and
must inevitably perish when the spring floods came. He
also speedily ascertained that the Governor, by no means
relishing his presence in the vicinity, was already planning
measures to thwart, if not to capture, his rivals, for he had
sent out two sailors charged with the task of discovering the
exact whereabouts of the French and the extent of their
strength and equipment.</p>

<p>These two spies Radisson promptly captured&mdash;no difficult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
task indeed, for they had lost their way and were half-frozen
and almost famished. The anticipated fate of the <i>Prince
Rupert</i> was not long delayed. The tidings shortly reached
Radisson that she was a total wreck, and with it came also
the news of the loss of her captain, the mate and four sailors.
A subsequent report, however, declared that Gillam had
escaped with his life.</p>

<p>Receiving this intelligence, Radisson presented himself
before the Governor to see how he was affected by such a
calamity.</p>

<p>He found Bridgar drinking heavily, but resolved to keep up
appearances and to withhold from the French any knowledge
of what had happened. He affected to believe the ship
safe, merely observing that she had shifted her position a
few leagues down the river. Radisson asserts that at this
time the Company's factory was short of provisions. It is
impossible that this could have been the case. The assertion
was probably made to cover his own depredations on the
stores of the Company.</p>

<p>Parting from the Governor, Radisson presented himself
before Gillam the younger, to whom he did not as yet choose
to say anything concerning his father and the loss of his ship.
Under various pretences he induced Gillam to pay him a visit
at Fort Bourbon. The latter does not seem at this time to
have been aware of the intention of the French towards him.
But he was soon to be undeceived.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Radisson's
threats.</p>

<p>"I remained quiet for a month," says Radisson, in the
course of his extraordinary narrative, "treating young Gillam,
my new guest, well and with all sorts of civilities, which he
abused on several occasions. For having apparently perceived
that we had not the strength I told him, he took the
liberty of speaking of me in threatening terms behind my
back, treating me as a pirate and saying that in spite of me
he would trade in spring with the Indians. He had even
the hardihood to strike one of my men, which I pretended
not to notice; but, having the insolence later, when we were
discussing the privileges of New England, to speak against
the respect due the best of kings, I treated him as a worthless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
dog for speaking in that way and told him that, having had
the honour to eat bread in his service, I would pray to God
all my life for his Majesty. He left me, threatening that he
would return to his fort and that when he was there I would
not dare to speak to him as I had done. I could not expect
to have a better opportunity to begin what I had resolved
to do. I told this young brute then that I
had brought him from his fort, that I would
take him back myself when I pleased, not when
he wished. He answered impertinently several times, which
obliged me to threaten that I would put him in a place
of safety if he was not wiser. He asked me then if he
was a prisoner. I said I would consider it and that I would
secure my trade since he threatened to interrupt it. I then
withdrew to give him time to be informed by the Englishmen
how his father's life was lost with the Company's ship, and the
bad situation of Mr. Bridgar. I left in their company a
Frenchman who understood English, unknown to them.
When I had left, young Gillam urged the Englishman to fly,
and to go to his master and assure him that he would give
him six barrels of powder and other supplies if he would
undertake to deliver him out of my hands. The Englishman
made no answer, but he did not inform me of the proposition
that had been made him (I had learned that from the Frenchman,
who had learned everything and thought it was time to
act for my security)."</p>

<p>In the evening Radisson said nothing of what he knew of
the plot. He asked those in his train if the muskets were in
their places, which he had put around to act as guarantee
against surprise. At the word <i>musket</i> young Gillam, who did
not know what was meant, grew alarmed and, according to
Radisson, wished to fly, believing that it was intended to kill
him. But his flight was arrested by his captor, who took
occasion to free him from his apprehension. The next morning,
however, the bushranger's plans were openly divulged.
He told Gillam that he was about to take his fort and ship.</p>

<p>"He answered haughtily that even if I had a hundred men
I could not succeed, and that his people would have killed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
more than forty before they could reach the palisades. This
boldness did not astonish me, being very sure that I would
succeed in my design."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Hays' Island
fort.</p>

<p>Having secured Gillam the younger, it was now necessary
to secure the fort of which he was master. The intrepid
Frenchman started for Hays' Island with nine
men, and gaining an entrance by strategy, he
cast off the mask of friendship and boldly
demanded the keys of the fort and the whole stock of arms
and powder. He added that in the event of their refusal to
yield he would raze the fort to the ground. No resistance
seems to have been attempted, and Radisson took formal
possession of the place in the name of the King of France.
This ceremony being concluded, he ordered Jenkins, the mate,
to conduct him to the ship, and here formal possession was
taken in the same fashion, without any forcible objection on
the part of the crew. Some explanation of this extraordinary
complaisance, if Radisson's story of the number of men he took
with him be true, may be found in the commander's unpopularity,
he having recently killed his supercargo in a quarrel.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Benjamin Gillam was not to be altogether
without friends.</p>

<p>A certain Scotchman, perchance the first of his race in
those regions, which were afterwards to be forever associated
with Scottish zeal and labours, wishing to show his fidelity to
his chief, escaped, and eluding the efforts of the fleetest of the
French bushrangers to catch him, he arrived at Fort Nelson
and told his tale. The Governor's astonishment may be
imagined. He had hitherto no inkling of the presence of
the New England interlopers, and although his captain and
fellow-servant was not equally ignorant, Gillam had kept his
counsel well. The Governor decided at once to head a party
of relief, in which he was seconded by the elder Gillam, who
was at the moment only just recovering from illness caused
by exposure during the shipwreck. The <i>Susan</i> was their first
point of attack. Under the cover of night they made a
determined effort to recapture her for the Company. It is
possible that the attempt might have succeeded had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Radisson, suspecting the move, despatched his entire available
force at the same time and completely overpowered the Governor's
men. He thought at first sight that Bridgar himself
was among his prisoners, but the Governor was not to be
caught in that fashion; he had not himself boarded the ship.
The Scotchman who accompanied him, however, was not so
fortunate; he fell into Radisson's hands and suffered for his
zeal. He was tied to a post and informed that his execution
would take place without ceremony on the morrow. The
sentence was never carried out. For Radisson, after exposing
his prisoner to the cold all night in an uncomfortable position,
seems to have thought better of his threat, and after numerous
vicissitudes the Scot at length regained his liberty.</p>

<p>Reinforcements for the French now arrived from Groseilliers.
Believing himself now strong enough to beard the lion
in his lair, Radisson decided to lose no more time in rounding
off his schemes. First, however, he saw fit to address a letter
to the Governor asking him if he "approved the action of the
Company's people whom he held prisoners, who had broken
two doors and the storeroom of his ship, in order to carry off
the powder."</p>

<p>Bridgar's reply was that he owed no explanation to a
renegade employee of the Company. Radisson had not been
sincere in his professions, and he had dealt basely and deceitfully
with him in preserving silence on the subject of the
interlopers. "As I had proper instructions," concluded
Bridgar, in a more conciliatory strain, "on setting sail from
London to seize all ships coming to this quarter, I would
willingly have joined hands with you in capturing this vessel.
If you wish me to regard you as sincere you will not keep
this prize for your own use."</p>

<p>The other's response was rapid and masterly. He marched
upon Fort Nelson with twelve men, and by the following
nightfall was master of the English establishment. This feat
nearly drove the unhappy Governor to despair, and he sought
solace by applying himself to the rum cask with greater
assiduity than ever. In the frame of mind thus superinduced,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
John Bridgar, the first Governor of Port Nelson, was
carried off a prisoner to Fort Bourbon.</p>

<p>This post was built of logs, as the others had been, but
there was a bastion of stone at one end facing the river. It
occupied, as nearly as one may now ascertain, the site upon
which was afterwards reared York Factory. But in the course
of the seventy years following the post was shifted slightly
from site to site, when the exigencies of fire and other causes
of destruction demanded a new building.</p>

<p>A few days after the Governor's arrival at Fort Bourbon,
the first Indians began to appear with provisions, which
were now beginning to be very sorely required. To the chief
of this band Radisson related the story, properly garnished,
of his exploits, realizing well how such things appeal to the
savage heart. While the Indians were pondering upon his
valour, great was their surprise to behold about the fort,
a number of English, whom Radisson had made prisoners;
and upon learning that there were others at York Factory
and Hays' Island, they very handsomely offered 200
beavers for permission to go thither and massacre them.
This offer Radisson wisely declined; but it seems clear that
he did his best to stir up enmity amongst his Indian friends
against the English. In this he was not entirely successful.
Good news travels fast, too; and the Indians had got wind
of Bridgar's boast that rather than see the trade pass into
the hands of the French it was his intention to offer six
axes for a beaver and as much merchandise in proportion.</p>

<p>They had, besides, reason to believe in the superior generosity
of the English traders as compared with the French.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Destruction of
La Chesnaye's
vessels.</p>

<p>It was now April, 1683. On the 22nd a disaster little
foreseen by Radisson or Groseilliers occurred, which involved
the destruction of their own frail ships. The <i>St. Pierre</i>
and the <i>St. Anne</i> had been hauled into a small stream
as far as possible in the woods and there sheltered by a
knoll. At ten o'clock on the night named all at Fort
Bourbon were awakened by a frightful noise, caused by the
breaking up of the ice. The occupants of the fort rushed
outside to find the waters everywhere rising with almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
incredible rapidity; and the masses of ice blocking up the
mouth of the creek caused a complete general submersion.
La Chesnaye's two vessels offered no strong
resistance to the flood, and presently began
to crack and splinter in all parts. In a few
hours all that remained sound were the bottoms,
clinging fast to the ice and mud.</p>

<p>A similar fate was apprehended for the New England ship,
and Radisson made all haste thither. She was saved only by
his adopting the suggestion of Bridgar, that the ice be carefully
cut all about the <i>Susan</i>, as he had heard of Governor
Bailey doing on a previous occasion. The ice once cut, the
vessel was only pushed by the strength of the floes to one
side, where she remained aground with little damage.</p>

<p>The chief concern of the leaders of the French now was
to get the English safely out of the country as soon as
possible, before the arrival of the Company's ships. To this
end Radisson and Groseilliers offered them the hull of the
<i>St. Anne</i> which, they believed, could with industry be
patched up with new timber sufficiently well to withstand a
voyage. When the English saw that these were the best terms
they could expect, and that if they were left at the mercy
of the Indians a much worse fate might be in store for them,
they set to work with a will. The labour proved arduous,
and they had suffered terribly. Four had died from cold and
hunger, and two had been poisoned from having rashly
drunk of a liquor they had found in the medicine-room
chest, without knowing its nature; another had had his
arm broken quite recently by a musket shot while out
hunting. The Governor felt that his sole hope lay in the
expected ships of the Company. He seems to have always
adopted a high tone in dealing with the French, even to
the last. He declared to Radisson that it was only one
of three things that could oblige him to abandon the place,
"the order of his masters, force, or famine." Groseilliers
now counselled burning the island fort, in order to do away
with the necessity of keeping perpetual guard there, and of
always taking precautions to protect themselves against the
Governor's intrigues.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>This advice was acted upon forthwith; the fort was burned
and a small lodge erected to accommodate such of the New
Englanders as had not been carried to Fort Bourbon, or
were not at work on the hull of the wrecked ship.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Arrival of the
Indians.</p>

<p>Early in May the Indians began to appear in great
numbers. Bridgar&mdash;who, divested of his command and
robbed of his stores, was now allowed at large&mdash;heard of
their arrival with joy. He seems to have believed that their
chiefs would not repudiate their treaties with the Company.
He hoped in any case to be granted the privilege of a
conference with them, but in this he was quickly undeceived.</p>

<p>Radisson went forward to meet the Indians,
who had come well loaded with peltries and
who were much perturbed at discovering the
helpless state of the Governor and the ascendancy of the
French. But they showed no disinclination to trade with
the latter, in spite of their solemn covenant, provided Groseilliers
and his brother-in-law would do so on the same terms as
the English. Both the bushrangers, however, seem to have
been determined to put an immediate stop to what they
termed folly. Let the Company give six axes for a beaver
if it chose; for themselves they would countenance no such
wantonness; two would suffice.</p>

<p>The tribe being assembled and having spread out their
customary gifts, consisting of beaver tails, smoked moose
tongues and pemmican, one of the leading braves arose
and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Men who pretend to give us life, do you wish us to die?
You know what beaver is worth and the trouble we have
to take it. You call yourselves our brothers and yet will
not give us what those give who make no such profession.
Accept our gifts, and let us barter, or we will visit you no
more. We have but to travel a hundred leagues and we
will encounter the English, whose offers we have heard."</p>

<p>On the conclusion of this harangue, silence reigned for
some moments. All eyes were turned on the two white
traders. Feeling that now or never was the time to exhibit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
firmness, Radisson, without rising to his feet, addressed the
whole assemblage in haughty accents.</p>

<p>"Whom dost thou wish I should answer? I have heard a
dog bark; when a man shall speak he will see I know how to
defend my conduct and my terms. We love our brothers and
we deserve their love in return. For have we not saved them
all from the treachery of the English?"</p>

<p class="sidenote">Radisson
overawes
the Indians.</p>

<p>Uttering these words fearlessly, he leapt to his feet and
drew a long hunting knife from his belt. Seizing
by the scalp-lock the chief of the tribe, who
had already adopted him as his son, he asked,
"Who art thou?" To which the chief responded,
as was customary, "Thy father."</p>

<p>"Then," cried Radisson, "if that is so, and thou art my
father, speak for me. Thou art the master of my goods; but
as for that dog who has spoken, what is he doing in this company?
Let him go to his brothers, the English, at the head
of the Bay. Or he need not travel so far: he may, if he
chooses, see them starving and helpless on yonder island:
answering to my words of command."</p>

<p>"I know how to speak to my Indian father," continued
Radisson, "of the perils of the woods, of the abandonment of
his squaws and children, of the risks of hunger and the peril
of death by foes. All these you avoid by trading with us here.
But although I am mightily angry I will take pity on this
wretch and let him still live. Go," addressing the brave with
his weapon outstretched, "take this as my gift to you, and
depart. When you meet your brothers, the English, tell them
my name, and add that we are soon coming to treat them and
their factory yonder as we have treated this one."</p>

<p>The speaker knew enough of the Indian character, especially
in affairs of trade, to be aware that a point once yielded
them is never recovered. And it is but just to say that the
terms he then made of three axes for a beaver were thereafter
adopted, and that his firmness saved the Company many a
cargo of these implements. His harangue produced an
immediate impression upon all save the humiliated brave,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
who declared that if the Assiniboines came hither to barter he
would lay in ambush and kill them.</p>

<p>The French trader's reply to this was to the Indian mind a
terrible one.</p>

<p>"I will myself travel into thy country," said he, "and eat
sagamite in thy grandmother's skull."</p>

<p>While the brave and his small circle of friends were livid
with fear and anger, Radisson ordered three fathoms of
tobacco to be distributed; observing, contemptuously, to the
hostile minority that as for them they might go and smoke
women's tobacco in the country of the lynxes. The barter
began, and when at nightfall the Indians departed not a skin
was left amongst them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Departure of
the English.</p>

<p>It was now time to think of departure. As absent men tell
no tales, it was decided to despatch Bridgar and his companions
first. But at the last moment some trouble seems to
have arisen as to which vessel the English
should have to convey them to more hospitable
shores. Bridgar himself would have preferred
to go in the ship, and at first his passage had been arranged
for in that craft; but it was at length settled that he should
be carried with the brothers-in-law in their barque.</p>

<p>After numerous vicissitudes, which would need a volume
to describe, the <i>St. Anne</i> arrived at the mouth of the St.
Lawrence.</p>

<p>At Tadoussac was a trading post belonging to the French:
and the sight of it seems to have inspired either one or both
of these conscienceless adventurers with the idea of lightening
their load of furs, which consisted of above two thousand
skins, though this cargo only represented about one-third of
the number they had actually secured by cheating, robbery
and intrigue in the country of the Bay.</p>

<p>Having in this nefarious manner disposed of about half of
La Chesnaye's property jointly with themselves, they again
set sail and arrived at Quebec on the 26th of October.</p>

<p>Immediately on their arrival they went to report themselves
to M. de la Barre, the Governor, La Chesnaye being fortunately,
or unfortunately, absent in Montreal. The Governor
thought proper to return the <i>Susan</i> to the New England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
merchants, with a warning not to send again to the place
from which she had just come, and the Company's ill-starred
Governor, Bridgar, together with young Gillam, sailed on
board her for New England.</p>

<p>"We parted," says Radisson with that matchless audacity
of statement for which his narrative deserves to be famous,
"on friendly terms; and he (Bridgar) could testify that I let
him know at the time my attachment; and yet, that I wished
still to act as heartily in the service of the King and the
nation as I wished to do for France."</p>

<p>This hardly tallies with Bridgar's evidence before the Company,
that Radisson was "a cheat, a swindler, and a black-hearted,
infamous scoundrel," and that he was "a born
intriguing traitor." As for the elder Gillam, he was heard to
declare, when he had at length arrived on the frail and half-rotten
craft which bore him and his unhappy comrades to
New England, that he would not die happy until his "hangar
had dipped into the blood of the French miscreant, Radisson."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Radisson and
Groseilliers
leave Quebec.</p>

<p>Quebec soon got too hot for both of the brothers-in-law.
Between the unfortunate La Chesnaye, who saw himself some
thousand crowns out of pocket, and the Governor, who had
received orders from France to despatch to the
Court the two adventurers who seemed bent on
making trouble between the two crowns, Radisson
and Groseilliers decided to leave Quebec,
which they did in about a fortnight after their arrival.</p>

<p>The exact date of their departure was the 11th of November,
1683, and it was effected on board a French frigate which
had brought troops to the colony. But though the captain of
the frigate made all haste, the frail and shattered <i>St. Anne</i>,
with Captain Gillam on board, arrived in Europe before
them; and soon England was ringing with his story of the
dastardly encroachment of the French into the realms of the
Company at Port Nelson.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">Lord Preston
informed of
the return of
Radisson and
Groseilliers.</p>

<p>Lord Preston, who, in the year 1684, held the post of
Ambassador Extraordinary of King Charles II. at the Court
of Versailles, was advised of the return to Paris of the bushranger
Radisson in these terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"My Lord: It has just reached our ears and that of his
Royal Highness the Duke of York, Governor of the Honourable
Hudson's Bay Company, that the person who has caused
all the recent trouble in the Hudson's Bay regions whereby
our merchants have suffered so much at the hands of the
French, is at this moment in Paris. As it is much in the
interests of the nation as of the Company that there should
be no repetition of these encroachments and disturbances, it
might be advantageous for your Lordship to see this Mr.
Radisson who, it is believed, could be brought
over again to our service if he were so entreated
by your Lordship. His Royal Highness, together
with the other Honourable partners, are
convinced from his previous conduct that it
matters little to Mr. Radisson under whose standard he
serves; and that, besides, he is secretly well disposed toward
us, and this in spite of his late treacherous exploits which
have given great offence to the nation and damage to the
Company."</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0123" id="im_0123"></a>
<img src="images/im_0123.jpg" width="383" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Captain Godey's Visit to Radisson.</span><br />
(<i>See page <a href="#Page_112">112</a>.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>This private note was signed by Sir John Hays and Mr.
Young on behalf of the Company. On its receipt by Lord
Preston, he at once sent his attaché, Captain Godey, to seek
out Radisson and make overtures to him. On the third floor
of a house in the Faubourg St. Antoine, surrounded by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
number of his relations and boon companions, the dual traitor
was discovered, deeply engaged in drinking healths and in
retailing his adventures to the applause of an appreciative
circle. Upon the walls and mantelpiece of the apartment, and
such meagre furniture as it boasted, were disposed numerous
relics and trophies, bespeaking a thirty years' career in the
Transatlantic wilderness.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Radisson's
appearance
in Paris.</p>

<p>"Radisson himself," remarks Godey, "was apparelled more
like a savage than a Christian. His black hair, just touched
with grey, hung in a wild profusion about his bare neck and
shoulders. He showed a swart complexion, seamed and
pitted by frost and exposure in a rigorous climate. A huge
scar, wrought by the tomahawk of a drunken Indian, disfigured
his left cheek. His whole costume was surmounted
by a wide collar of marten's skin; his feet were adorned by
buckskin moccasins. In his leather belt was sheathed a long
knife." Such was the picture presented by this
uncouth, adventurous Huguenot, not merely
in the seclusion of his own lodgings, but
to the polished and civilized folk of Paris
of the seventeenth century. What were the projects harboured
in this indomitable man's mind? In spite of his
persistent intrigues it is to be doubted if he, any more than
Médard Chouart des Groseilliers, was animated by more
than a desire to pursue an exciting and adventurous career.
Habitually holding out for the best terms, he does not appear
to have saved money when it was acquired, but spent it
freely. When he died he was in receipt of a pension from
the Company, so far insufficient to provide for his manner of
living that they were forced to pay his remaining debts.</p>

<p>Unabashed by the surroundings thus presented to him,
Captain Godey announced himself, shook hands with the
utmost cordiality with Radisson, and pleaded to be allowed
to join in the convivial proceedings then in progress. The
better to evince his sincerity, without further ceremony he
accepted and drank as full a bumper of bad brandy and
applauded with as much heartiness as any man of the party
the truly astonishing tales of their host.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>Godey was the last of the guests to depart.</p>

<p>"Look you," said he, when he and Radisson were alone
together, "you, monsieur, are a brave man, and it does not
become the brave to harbour vengeance. Nor does it become
a brave nation to think hardly of any man because of his
bravery, even though that nation itself be a sufferer. You
know," he pursued, "what is said about you in England?"</p>

<p>Radisson interrupted his guest by protesting with warmth
that he neither knew nor cared anything about such a matter.</p>

<p>"It is said, then," answered Godey, "that you have been a
traitor to the king, and that there is no authority or defence
for your conduct. You and Groseilliers, whilst professing
friendship for the English Company have done them great
injury, and endangered the peace between the two crowns."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," rejoined Radisson, "but all that I and
my brother-in-law have done, is to be laid at the door of
the Hudson's Bay Company. We wished honestly to serve
them, but they cast us away as being no longer useful,
when now they see what it is they have done, and how
foolishly they have acted in listening to the counsels of
Governor Bridgar. We really bear them no ill-will, neither
the Company nor his Royal Highness."<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">Godey's
report.</p>

<p>The gallant emissary reported the tenor of this conversation
forthwith to his master, and both were agreed as to the
sort of man they had to deal with. Godey expressed himself
convinced that there would be little difficulty
in inducing Radisson to return to the Company's
service. On this advice Preston at
once wrote off to Mr. Young, telling him not to further
press the Company's memorial to the King, nor to seek
to have the French Court take cognizance of, and award
recompense for, the wrongs done the English interests.
"Radisson has done this thing out of his own head, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
is the one man competent to undo it. He is, I learn, well-disposed
to the English, and there is no reason, if proper
overtures be made him, why he should not do more for the
English interests in that region than he has yet done."</p>

<p>At the same time La Barre, the French Governor, was
urged to make the most strenuous efforts to retain the advantages
for the French by the two adventurers. A royal
despatch of August 5th, 1683, and signed by Lewis himself,
had already been sent, in these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I recommend you to prevent the English as much as
possible from establishing themselves in Hudson's Bay,
possession whereof was taken in my name several years ago;
and as Colonel d'Unguent,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> appointed Governor of New York
by the King of England, has had precise orders on the part
of the said King to maintain good correspondence with us
and carefully to avoid whatever may interrupt it, I doubt not
the difficulties you have experienced will cease for the future."</p>
</div>

<p>Lewis was by no means desirous of rendering the position
of his fellow monarch over the Channel uncomfortable.
He was disposed to yield in a small matter when he had his
own way in most of the large ones. Had Charles yielded to
French representations about Port Nelson he would have
given great offence to his brother the Duke of York. Indeed,
there is little doubt that had the Company not boasted members
of such distinction, or the patronage of royalty, the
French would have at this juncture forced their demands and
overwhelmed the English possession. Radisson appears to
have got wind of the situation and this was, perhaps, to him
a greater argument for returning to the service of the power
likely to be most permanent in Hudson's Bay. He, however,
hung about idle in Paris for some weeks, in a state of
indecision. Had M. de Seignely exerted his full powers of
persuasion, he might have induced our bushranger to remain
in the service of Lewis. But no such inducement was offered.
There is some reason to believe that M. de Seignely undervalued
Radisson; but in any case the apathy of the Court
influenced his actions.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>The bushranger was, on the other hand, exhorted to return
to his first engagement with the English, Lord Preston assuring
him that if he could in reality execute what he proposed,
he would receive in England from his Majesty, from his Royal
Highness, from the Company, and from the nation, "every
sort of good treatment and entire satisfaction." The Duke's
especial protection was also guaranteed. Radisson, none too
punctilious, at length made up his mind as to the course he
would pursue.</p>

<p>"I yielded," says he, "to these solicitations and determined
to go to England forever, and so strongly bind myself to his
Majesty's service, and to that of those interested in the
nation, that no other cause could ever detach me from it."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Radisson decides
to join
the English.</p>

<p>But in order that he might have an excuse for his conduct,
the very day that he arrived at this decision he is found
writing to the French Minister demanding a certain grant
in the north-west of Canada as an alternative
to a former proposal that "in consideration of
his discoveries, voyages and services he should
be given every fourth beaver, trapped or otherwise
caught in those territories." M. de Seignely had no
suspicion of the depth of Radisson's duplicity. The minister
thought him "a vain man, much given to boasting, who
could do much harm, and had therefore best have his vanity
tickled at home."</p>

<p>Up to the very eve of his departure, April 24, 1684, he
was a daily attendant on the minister or his subordinates
of the Department of Marine and Commerce. He was
not always favoured with an audience; but when listened to
spoke vaguely of fitting out and equipping vessels for trade
on voyages similar to those he had already undertaken. His
<i>naiveté</i>, to use no harsher term, is remarkable.</p>

<p>"In order," says he, "that they should not suspect anything
by my sudden absence, I told them I was obliged to
take a short trip into the country on friendly family matters.
<i>I myself made good use of this time to go to London.</i>"</p>

<p>He arrived in the English capital on the 10th of May, and
immediately paid his respects to Mr. Young. The project for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
regaining possession of York Factory was canvassed. Radisson
estimated that there would be between fifteen and twenty
thousands beaver skins in the hands of his nephew, awaiting
shipment. The partners appeared more than satisfied, and
Radisson met with a most cordial reception. He was assured
that the Company had entire confidence in him, and that their
greatest regret was that there had been any misunderstanding
between them. They would, it was declared on their behalf,
make all amends in their power.</p>

<p>For a few weeks the Hudson's Bay bushranger found
himself a lion. He was presented to the King in the course
of a <i>levee</i>. Charles listened with the greatest assumption
of interest to the adventurer's account of himself, and to
his asseverations of loyalty and good will. Radisson in the
evening was taken to the play-house in the suite of his Royal
Highness, and there by his bizarre attire attracted almost as
much attention amongst the audience as the play itself.</p>

<p>"To the Duke's Play-house," writes John Selwyn to his
wife, "where Radisson, the American fur-hunter, was in the
Royal box. Never was such a combination of French,
English and Indian savage as Sir John Kirke's son-in-law.
He was not wont to dress so when he was last here, but he
has got him a new coat with much lace upon it, which he
wears with his leather breeches and shoes. His hair is a
perfect tangle. It is said he has made an excellent fortune
for himself."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Radisson's
departure for
Hudson's Bay.</p>

<p>After a number of conferences with the partners, Radisson
finally departed from Gravesend on May 17. Three ships set
sail, that in which Radisson was embarked being named the
<i>Happy Return</i>. The elements being favourable, the little fleet
reached the Straits more speedily than usual.
The chief figure of this expedition, who had
never borne a part in any joint enterprise without
being animated by jealousy and distrust,
found here ample scope for the exercise of his characteristic
vices. During nearly the entire period of the voyage he
evinced a perpetual and painful apprehension that one of the
other ships carrying officials and servants of the Company
would, with malicious intentions, arrive before him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>His first concern on awaking in the morning was to be
assured that the companion vessels were in sight, and
although the <i>Happy Return</i> was the most sluggish sailor of
the trio, yet to such good purpose were plied the bushranger's
energies and promises that her commander's seamanship
made her a capital match for the others.</p>

<p>But just before their destination was reached contrary
winds, currents and masses of floating ice brought about a
separation, and Radisson began to be assailed more than ever
by the fear that the English servants would arrive on the
ground, overwhelm his nephew and the other French without
his assistance, and thus frustrate all his plans for claiming
sole credit. And in truth this fear was very nearly justified.
Twenty leagues from Port Nelson the ship got blocked amidst
the masses of ice, and progress, except at a raft's pace, became
out of the question. In this dilemma, Radisson demanded of
the captain a small boat and seven men. His request being
granted, it was launched, and after undergoing forty-eight
hours' fatigue, without rest or sleep, the entrance to Nelson
River was reached. Imagine Radisson's surprise, as well as
that of his companions, on beholding two ships at anchor,
upon one of which, a complete stranger to them, floated the
Royal Standard of England.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The presence
of the French
made known.</p>

<p>It was the English frigate which had entered at Port
Nelson. The other ship was the <i>Alert</i>, commanded by
Captain Outlaw, having brought out the Company's new
Governor, William Phipps, the previous season. Radisson
boldly headed his boat for this vessel, and when he drew near,
perceived Bridgar's successor, with all his people in arms, on
the quarter-deck. The Governor, in a loud voice, instantly
demanded to know who Radisson was. Upon his making
himself and his allegiance known, they decided to permit him
to board the Company's ship. The bushranger first made it his
care to be informed how the land lay, and he was inwardly
rejoiced to learn that the Governor and his men had not
dared to land, out of fear for the French and Indians, who
were considered hostile to the English interests. This was
precisely the situation Radisson most desired; a thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
seems to have struck him that after all, his nephew, Chouart,
might prove intractable, and by no means so easily won over
as he had anticipated. It therefore behooved him to act with
adroitness and circumspection. Taking with him two men,
Radisson proceeded up country in the direction of the abandoned
York Factory, hourly hoping that they might discover
something, or at least they should make someone hear, or see
a friendly Indian, by firing musket shots or making a smoke.
The attempt was not fruitless, as he tells us, for after a while
they perceived ten canoes with Indians coming down the
river. "At first," he says, "I thought some Frenchmen might
be with them, whom my nephew might have sent to discover
who the new arrivals were." Upon this supposition Radisson
severed himself from his comrades, and going to meet the
savages he made the usual signs to them from the bank, which
the Indians at first seemed to respond to in no amiable spirit.
Albeit, on addressing them in their own tongue, he was
immediately recognized, the Indians testifying by shouts and
playful postures to their joy at his arrival. He
quickly learned from them that his nephew and
the other Frenchmen were above the rapids,
four leagues from the place where they then
were. They had expected Groseilliers would accompany
Radisson, and when they expressed surprise that this was not
the case, Radisson did not scruple to tell them that Groseilliers
awaited him at a short distance.</p>

<p>"But what," asked Radisson, "are you doing here? What
brings you into this part of the country and in such numbers?"</p>

<p>The savage leader's sudden confusion betrayed him to
Radisson. The circumstance of the Indians voluntarily seeking
trade with the English greatly simplified the situation.</p>

<p>"Look you," said he, heartily, at the same time calling to
Captain Geyer, who was in ambush hard by, "I am glad to
find you seeking trade with the English. I have made peace
with the English for the love of our Indian brothers; you,
they and I are to be henceforth only one. Embrace us, therefore,
in token of peace; this (pointing to Geyer) is your new
brother. Go immediately to your son at the fort yonder and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
carry him these tidings and the proofs of peace. Tell him to
come and see me at this place, while the others will wait for
me at the mouth of the river."</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that the chief of this band had
previously announced himself as young Chouart's sire, according
to the Indian custom. He now readily departed on his
mission.</p>

<p>Radisson passed an anxious night. The sun had been
risen some hours before his eyes were gladdened by the
sight of a canoe, in which he descried Chouart. The young
man's countenance bore, as well it might, an expression of
profound amazement; and at first hardly the bare civilities
of relationship passed between the pair. Chouart waited
patiently for his uncle to render an explanation of the
news which had reached him. Silently and slowly they
walked together, and after a time the prince of liars, traitors,
adventurers and bushrangers began his account of his
position.</p>

<p>Radisson states that his nephew immediately acquiesced in
his scheme. A memoir penned in 1702, the year of Radisson's
death, by M. Barthier, of Quebec, asserts that the young
man received with the utmost disgust, and flatly declined to
entertain, his relative's proposals. He expressed, on the other
hand, the greatest grief on hearing the news; for he had
begun to believe that it was through their efforts that the
dominion of the king had been extended in that region.
Now it appeared that this labour had all been in vain. It was
only his love for his mother, Radisson's sister, which prevented
an open rebellion on the part of Chouart against the proposed
treachery.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Chouart
surrenders
to Radisson.</p>

<p>No rupture took place; the stronger and more crafty spirit
prevailed. Chouart surrendered on the following day his
command of the fort. He had, he complained,
expected a far different fate for the place and
his men. The tattered old <i>fleur de lis</i> standard
brought by the <i>St. Anne's</i> captain from Quebec
was lowered and the English emblem, with the device of the
Company, run up in its stead. All the forces were assembled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
and amidst cheers for King Charles and the Honourable
Adventurers, the Company's Governor took formal possession.</p>

<p>But the French bushrangers and sailors watched these
proceedings with melancholy dissatisfaction, not, perhaps, as
much from patriotic motives as from the frailty of their own
tenure. They could no longer be assured of a livelihood
amongst so many English, who bore themselves with so
haughty a mien.</p>

<p>Radisson proceeded to make an inventory of all the skins
on hand, together with all those concealed in <i>caches</i> in the
woods. The results showed 239 packages of beaver, or about
12,000 skins, together with merchandise sufficient to barter
for seven or eight thousand more. Instructions were now
given by Radisson, the Governor remaining passive, to have
all these goods taken in canoes to the ships.</p>

<p>It now only remained for the bushranger to accomplish
one other object before setting sail with the cargo for England.
Radisson speaks of himself as having a secret commission, but
no authority can be found for his statement. It involved the
retention in the Company's service of his nephew and the
other Frenchmen; but even assuming that Radisson were
armed with any such instructions, the plan was not likely
to enjoy the approval of Governor Phipps, who, if he were
at the outset of his term of office determined upon any one
thing, it was that Fort Nelson should be cleared of Frenchmen.
Exactly how this was to be arranged was not quite
clear, especially as there was yet no open rupture between
the two authorities. But for such a rupture they had not
long to wait. They were destined on the very eve of his
departure to be involved in a quarrel.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Dispute
between
Radisson and
the Governor.</p>

<p>Some years before an Assiniboine chief named Ka-chou-touay
had taken Radisson to his bosom and adopted him as
his son with all the customary ceremonies. This formidable
chief, who had been at war with a neighbouring tribe at the
time of his adopted son's arrival in the country, now put in
an appearance. Instead of the joy Radisson expected it was
with reproaches that he was greeted. Ka-chou-touay informed
him that a brother chief of his, named La Barbé, with one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
his sons, had been killed while expostulating with a party of
English. The consequences of this rash action might be so
grave that Radisson felt it to be his duty to resort to the
Governor and demand that his servants should be punished
for the crime, or else he would not be answerable for the consequences.
The Governor does not appear to have taken
Radisson's demand in good part, declining altogether
to intervene in the matter. The other
now proceeded to commands and threats. He
asserted that as long as he remained in the
country the Governor was his subordinate, which
greatly angered that official and high words passed.</p>

<p>The task the Governor had set himself was by no means
easy, especially if he wished to avoid bloodshed. But the
plan of overpowering and disarming the French was finally
accomplished through strategy. All were escorted aboard
the ship, even to Chouart himself, and on the fourth of
September sail was set.</p>

<p>On this voyage Radisson's state of mind rivalled that which
he had experienced when outward bound. His late anxiety
to be the first upon the scene at Port Nelson was paralleled
now by his desire to be the first in London. If happily, the
Company should first hear an account of what had transpired
from himself, he felt convinced full measure of justice would
be done him. If, on the other hand, Governor Phipps' relation
were first received there was no knowing how much
prejudice might be raised against him.</p>

<p>Great as was his impatience, he managed to hide it with
adroitness, so that none save his nephew suspected the intention
he shortly executed. The captain, crew and Company's
servants left the ship leisurely at Portsmouth. Those going
up to London lingered for the coach, but not so with Radisson,
who instantly made his way to the post-house, where he
hired a second-rate steed, mounted it and, without the courtesy
of an adieu to his late comrades, broke into a gallop,
hardly restrained until London bridge was reached.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Phipps' letter
to the
Company.</p>

<p>His arrival took place close upon midnight, but late as was
the hour, he took no thought of securing lodging or of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
apprising his wife of his advent. He spurred on his stumbling
horse to the dwelling of Mr. Young, in Wood Street,
Cheapside. The honourable adventurer had retired for the
night, but, nevertheless, in gown and night-cap welcomed
Radisson with great cordiality. He listened, we are told,
with the greatest interest and satisfaction to the bushranger's
tale, garnished with details of his own marvellous prowess
and zeal for the Company. Nor, perhaps, was Radisson less
satisfied when, on attaining his own lodging, he pondered on
the day's exploits. He slumbered little, and at eleven o'clock
Young was announced, and was ushered in, declaring that he
had already been to Whitehall and apprised the Court of the
good news. His Majesty and his Royal Highness had
expressed a wish to see Radisson, the hero of these great
doings, and Young was accordingly brought to
escort the bushranger into the Royal presence.
It was a triumph, but a short-lived one.
Radisson had hardly left the precincts of the
Court, his ears still ringing with the praises of King and
courtiers, than the Deputy-Governor, Mr. Dering, received
Phipps' account of the affair, which was almost as unfair to
Radisson and the part he had played in the re-capture of
Port Nelson, as Radisson's own account was flattering.</p>

<p>On the receipt of the report, a General Court of the Adventurers
was held on September 26th. By the majority of
members the bushranger was hardly likely to be accorded full
justice, for great offence had been given by his presentation at
Court and the extremely informal manner of his arrival.
Despite the friendliness of Hays, Young and several other
partners, Radisson was not again granted a position of
authority in the Company's service.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile young Chouart, being detained in England
against his wish, decided to write to Denonville and propose
to accompany his uncle to Port Nelson and make his
escape and gain Quebec by land. The Governor forwarded
this letter to Paris and demanded permission to promise fifty
pistoles to those who would seize the traitor Radisson and
bring him to Quebec. The minister complied. But in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
March, 1687, he had had no success. "The misfortune," says
the minister, "that the man Radisson has done to the
colony, and that he is still capable of doing if he remains
longer amongst the English, should oblige Denonville and
Champagne to make every effort to seize him and so
judgment will be held out." Radisson did, it is true, make
another voyage to Hudson's Bay, but his sojourn was of brief
duration, and a plot set on foot to seize him failed.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards, "Peter Raddison" is found to be in
receipt of a pension of ten pounds a month from the Company,
which he continued to enjoy for many years to the time of
his death at Islington, in 1702.</p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<br />
1683-1686.</h2>

<p class="hanging">
Feigned Anger of Lewis&mdash;He writes to La Barre&mdash;Importance Attached
to Indian Treaties&mdash;Duluth's zeal&mdash;Gauthier de Comportier&mdash;Denonville
made Governor&mdash;Capture of the <i>Merchant of Perpetuana</i>&mdash;Expedition

</p>

<p>When the news of the expedition of 1684 reached the
Court of Versailles, Lewis professed anger that the peace
between the two crowns should be broken even in that remote
corner of the world. He related the discussion which had
taken place between the English ambassador and himself
with regard to Radisson's treachery. He had been happy,
he said, to inform King Charles's representative that he was
unwilling to afford his "brother of England" any cause of
complaint. Nevertheless, as he thought it important to prevent
the English from establishing themselves in that river, it
would be well to make a proposal to the commandant at
Hudson's Bay that neither French nor English should have
power to make any new establishments.</p>

<p>Long before that he had written to Governor La Barre, in
no measured terms, demanding of him what he meant by
releasing the Boston vessel, the <i>Susan</i>, without calling on
the Intendant, or consulting the sovereign council.</p>

<p>"You have herein done," said he, "just what the English
would be able to make a handle of, since in virtue of your
ordinance you caused a vessel to be surrendered which ought
strictly to be considered a pirate, as it had no commission;
and the English will not fail to say that you so fully recognized
the regularity of the ship's papers as to surrender it."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Duluth in the
West.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the receipt of this letter from his
monarch, there came to the perplexed Governor a letter from
the Sieur Duluth, stating that at great expense
of presents he had prevented the western tribes
from further carrying their beaver trade to the
English. He had, it appeared, met the Sieur de la Croix
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
with his two comrades, who had presented the despatches in
which the Governor had urged him to use every endeavour
in forwarding letters to Chouart, at Nelson River.</p>

<p>"To carry out your instructions," wrote Duluth, "there
was only Monsieur Péré, who would have to go himself, the
savages having all at that time withdrawn into the interior."
He added that Péré had left during the previous month, and
doubtless at that time had accomplished his mission. Duluth
invariably expressed himself with great confidence on the
subject of the implicit trust which the savages reposed in
him. More than once in his letters, as well as in verbal
messages forwarded to his superiors, he boasted that before a
couple of years were out not a single savage would visit the
English at Hudson's Bay. To this end they had bound
themselves by the numerous presents they had received at
his hands; and he was assured that they would not go back
on their word.</p>

<p>As with Duluth so with the other officials, pioneers and
emissaries amongst the French, great importance was
attached to treaties and compacts with the aborigines.
Every endeavour was made to obtain the good-will and
amity of the Indians.</p>

<p class="sidenote">French and
English relations
with the
Indians.</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing exhibits so powerfully the totally differing
attitude and motives of the Company, compared with the
French traders, than the manner in which, in those early
times, the Red man was trusted and believed by the one and
distrusted and contemned by the other. One may peruse
neither the narratives of the Jesuits nor of the traders
without an emotion of awe at the simple faith of those
pioneers in the honesty and probity of the Red
men. To the very end, when disaster succeeding
disaster overwhelmed the propaganda of
Loyola amongst the northern tribes and exterminated
its disciples, we read of the Frenchman
trusting to the word and deferring to the prejudices of his
Indian brother. It was as if the latter were indeed of a
common steadfastness and moral nature with his own.
Contrast that trait in the English character which is exhibited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
in his early dealings with inferior and black peoples
in India and Africa, to that he has retained to the present day.
Never was the contrast greater than during the acute conflict
of English and French interests in Hudson's Bay at this time.
The early governors and traders almost without exception
openly despised the Indian and secretly derided his most
solemn counsels. August treaties were set aside on the most
flimsy pretexts, and if the virtues of the savages were too
highly esteemed by the French, they were on the other hand
perhaps much too cheaply held by their rivals.</p>

<p>But to whatever extent they may have held themselves
bound by compacts of this kind, the Company's officials were
not so foolish as to doubt their potency amongst savages.
Thus we find that from the years 1682 to 1688 the Company
regularly instructed its servants to enact the strongest treaties
with the "captains and kings of the rivers and territories where
they had settlements." "These compacts," observes one of the
Company's servants, "were rendered as firm and binding as
the Indians themselves could make them. Ceremonies of
the most solemn and sacred character accompanied them."</p>

<p>Duluth had already built a fort near the River à la Maune,
at the bottom of Lake Nepigon, and thither he expected at
least six of the northern nations to resort in the spring. Lest
this should not be sufficient for the purpose he designed building
another in the Christineaux River, which would offer an
effectual barrier to the expansion of the English trade. With
characteristic zeal Duluth, in a letter written at this time,
concluded with these words:</p>

<p>"Finally, sir, I wish to lose my life if I do not absolutely
prevent the savages from visiting the English."</p>

<p>But with every good will to serve his monarch and stifle in
infancy the growing trade of the Hudson's Bay Company in
the northern regions, Duluth vastly undervalued the forces of
circumstance as well of enterprise at the command of the
enemy. The plans of the French were destined to be confounded
by the unforeseen and treacherous action of Radisson
and Chouart in the following year.</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" now became the burden of La
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Barre's appeals to the King. The young priest who acted
as his secretary at Quebec was kept perpetually writing to
Versailles for instructions. His letters are long, and filled
with explanations of the situation, which only served to
confuse his superiors. Fearful of offending the English
on one hand and thereby precipitating New France in a war
with New England, and on the other of arousing the resentment
of the colonists by a supine behaviour, the unhappy
Denonville was in an unpleasant dilemma.</p>

<p>"Am I to oppose force to force?" he asks in one letter.
"Am I to venture against those who have committed these
outrages against your Majesty's subjects at sea? It is a
matter in which your Majesty will please to furnish me
with some precise and decisive orders whereunto I shall
conform my conduct and actions."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Lewis
unwilling
to oppose
the English.</p>

<p>But the Most Christian King was by no means anxious
to quarrel with his cousin Charles either for the dominion
of, or the fur-trade monopoly in, the north. Charles was in
possession of a handsome subsidy paid out of
the exchequer of Lewis. Europe was spectator
of the most cordial relations between these two
monarchs, relations which are described by more
than one candid historian as those commonly
subsisting between master and vassal. That tempest of
indignation which was to break over England in the reign
of Charles's successor would have not so long been deferred
had but a real knowledge of the "good understanding and
national concord" been known to Englishmen at large.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances it is not surprising that Lewis
concluded to do nothing. It was not that opportunities to
regain what was lost were lacking. An old soldier, Gauthier
de Comportier, who with a number of other patriots had
learned of the jeopardy in which French interests lay in the
north, presented a memoir to the King offering, if a grant
were made him, to win all back from the English and to
establish three posts on the Bourbon River. The grant was
refused.</p>

<p>A change then came which altered the aspect of affairs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>In February, 1685, Charles II. died, and the Duke of York,
second Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, ascended
the throne of England. Lewis was not the last to perceive
that the accession of James would cause but little real difference,
as the latter and himself were bound together by ties
as strong as had bound Charles, yet saw at the same time
that full advantage might safely be reaped from the change
of monarchs. Proceedings were instantly therefore set on
foot to retrieve the fortunes of the French in the fur countries.</p>

<p>The conduct of Groseilliers and Radisson had deeply
offended the inhabitants of Quebec. An excited populace
burnt the pair in effigy, and a decree was issued for
their arrest should they at any time be apprehended, and
for their delivery to those whom they had betrayed. But it
was the anger of La Chesnaye and his associates of the
Company which was especially strong. An expedition which
they had sent out to Port Nelson, with the intention of
collecting the wealth in peltries, returned to the St. Lawrence
without so much as a single beaver.</p>

<p>The success of the English made some decided action on
the part of the French inevitable. La Barre was recalled
and his successor, the Marquis de Denonville, determined to
take matters into his own hands, rather than see the interests
of New France in the Bay suffer. He relied upon the success
of the expedition to atone for the boldness of the initiative,
but his action was not taken without repeated warnings
addressed to the Minister. "All the best of our furs, both
as to quality and quantity, we must expect to see shortly
in the hands of the English." If the English were not expelled
they would secure all the fat beaver from an infinite
number of tribes in the north who were being discovered
every day; besides abstracting the greater portion of the
peltries that ordinarily reached them at Montreal through
the Ottawas, Assiniboines and other tribes.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">The French
capture a
Company's
ship.</p>

<p>In the month of July, 1685, two ships belonging to the
French Company, returning in disappointment to Canada
from Port Nelson, met, at the mouth of the Straits, one of the
Hudson's Bay Company's vessels named the <i>Merchant of
Perpetuana</i>, commanded by one Edward Humes. She was
bound for York Fort with a cargo of merchandise
and provisions. No time was lost on the
part of the French in intercepting her. Captain
Humes not surrendering with sufficient alacrity
to please the enemy, the <i>Merchant of Perpetuana</i>
was boarded and forcibly possessed in the name of King
Lewis. Several English sailors lost their lives. The vessel
having been seized in this manner, her prow was headed
for Quebec, where her master and crew were summarily cast
into gaol.</p>

<p>After a miserable confinement, lasting eleven months, the
sufferings of Captain Humes ended with his death, and the
other prisoners, exposed to the insults and indignities of the
Quebec populace, were ultimately sent away to Martinique
on board their own ship, and there sold as slaves. The mate,
Richard Smithsend by name, managed to escape. Upon
reaching London the tale he unfolded to his employers
excited general indignation. A memorial of the outrage,
couched in vigorous language, was presented to the King,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
but James, resolved not to give offence to his friend and
ally the Most Christian King, took no notice of the matter.</p>

<p>Amongst the French in Canada there were not wanting
bold spirits to follow up this daring stroke. Chief amongst
them, not merely for the character of his achievements, but
for his uncommon and romantic personality, was the Chevalier
de Troyes. This Canadian nobleman, who was of
advanced years, was a retired captain in the army. He
believed he now saw an opportunity to win a lasting distinction,
and to rival, and perhaps surpass, the exploits of
Champlain, Lusson, Frontenac and the other hero-pioneers
of New France. Scholarly in his tastes, and frail of body,
though by profession a soldier, he emerged from privacy on
Christmas Eve, 1685, and asked of the Governor a commission
to drive the English utterly from the Northern Bay.</p>

<p>The authority the old soldier sought for was granted. He
was empowered to "search for, seize and occupy the most
advantageous posts, to seize the robbers, bushrangers and
others whom we know to have taken and arrested several of
our French engaged in the Indian trade, whom we order him
to arrest, especially the said Radisson and his adherents
wherever they may be found, and bring them to be punished
as deserters, according to the rigour of the ordinances." The
rigour of the ordinances was death.</p>

<p>Fourscore Canadians were selected to form part of the
expedition against the Hudson's Bay Company's posts by
the Chevalier de Troyes. For his lieutenants, the leader
chose the three sons of a nobleman of New France named
Charles Le Moine. One, the eldest, a young man of only
twenty-five, was to bear an enduring distinction in the annals
of France as one of her most able and intrepid naval
commanders. This was the Sieur d'Iberville. His brothers,
taking their names, as he had done, from places in their
native land, were called the Sieurs de Sainte Hèlène and de
Marincourt. Thirty soldiers were directly attached to the
Chevalier's command, veterans who had, almost to a man,
seen service in one or other of the great European wars.
That they might not be without the ministrations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
religion, Father Sylvie, a Jesuit priest, accompanied the
expedition.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Expedition of
de Troyes.</p>

<p>"The rivers," writes a chronicler of the Troyes expedition,
"were frozen and the earth covered with snow when that
small party of vigorous men left Montreal in
order to ascend the Ottawa River as far as the
height of land and thence to go down to
James' Bay." At the beginning of April they
arrived at the Long Sault, where they prepared some canoes
in order to ascend the Ottawa River. From Lake Temiscamingue
they passed many portages until they reached Lake
Abbitibi, at the entrance or most southern extremity of
which they built a small fort of stockades. After a short
halt they continued their course towards James' Bay.</p>

<p>The establishment first doomed to conquest by Troyes and
his companions was Moose Factory, a stockade fort having
four bastions covered with earth. In the centre was a house
forty feet square and as many high, terminating in a platform.
The fort was escaladed by the French late at night and the
palisades made short work of by the hatchets of their bushrangers.</p>

<p>Amongst the garrison none appears to have attempted a
decent defence save the chief gunner, who perished bravely
at his post of duty.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> A cry for quarter went up and the
English were made prisoners on the spot. They were sixteen
in number, and as the attack was made at night they were in
a state of almost complete undress. Troyes found in the
fort twelve cannon, chiefly six and eight-pounders, three
thousand pounds of powder and ten pounds of lead.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Capture
of Moose
Factory.</p>

<p>It is worthy of record that the capture was effected with an
amount of pomp and ceremony calculated to strike the deepest
awe into the hearts of those fifteen unhappy and not too
intelligent Company's apprentices, who knew nothing of fighting
nor had bargained for anything so perilous. For so small
a conquest it was both preceded and followed by almost as
much circumstance as would have sufficed for the Grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Monarque himself in one of his theatrical sieges. The
Chevalier announced in a loud voice that he took possession
of the fort and island "in the name of his
Most Christian Majesty the Most High, Most
Mighty, Most Redoubtable Monarch Lewis
XIV. of the Most Christian Name, King of
France and Navarre." In obvious imitation of Lusson, a sod
of earth was thrice raised in the air, whilst a cry of "Vive le
Roi" rang out over those waters wherein were sepultured
the bodies of Henry Hudson and his men.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The career of the Chevalier de Troyes ended
abruptly and tragically in 1687, when he and all his men,

canoes to attack a sloop belonging to the Company then
lying at anchor at the mouth of the latter river with fourteen
souls aboard, including the Governor. To accomplish this
stroke it was necessary to travel forty leagues along the sea
coast. The road was extremely difficult and in places
almost impassable. A shallop was constructed to carry a
couple of small cannon, and on the 25th of June Troyes
left for Fort Rupert.</p>

<p>St. Hèlène was sent on in advance to reconnoitre the
establishment. He returned with the information that it was
a square structure, flanked by four bastions, but that all was
in a state of confusion owing to repairs and additions then
being made to the fort. The cannon had not yet been placed,
being temporarily accommodated outside on the slope of a
redoubt.</p>

<p>Before the attack, which could only have one issue, was
made by the land forces, Iberville had boarded the Company's
sloop, surprised captain and crew, and made all,
including Governor Bridgar, prisoners. Four of the English
were killed.</p>

<p>After this exploit Iberville came ashore, rejoined his
superior and overpowered the almost defenceless garrison of
Fort Rupert.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>The French forces now united, and St Hèlène having been
as successful as his brother in securing the second of the
Company's ships, all embarked and sailed for the remaining
post of the Company in that part of the Bay.</p>

<p class="p2">Neither Troyes nor Iberville knew its precise situation; but
a little reconnoitring soon discovered it. Fort Albany was
built in a sheltered inlet forty yards from the borders of the
Bay. Two miles to the north-east was an <i>estrapade</i> on the
summit of which was placed a seat for a sentinel to sight the
ships expected from England and to signal them if all was
well. But on this morning, unhappily, no sentinel was there
to greet with a waving flag the Company's ship, on the deck
of which young Iberville stood.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Attack on
Fort
Albany.</p>

<p>Two Indians, however, brought Governor Sargeant tidings
of the approach of the enemy, and his previous successes at
Moose and Rupert rivers. The Governor immediately resolved
upon making a bold stand; all was instantly got in readiness
to sustain a siege, and the men were encouraged to behave
with fortitude. Two hours later the booming of cannon was
heard, and soon afterwards a couple of skirmishers were
sighted at a distance. Despite the Governor's example, the
servants at the fort were thrown into the
greatest confusion. Two of their number were
deputed by the rest to inform the Governor
that they were by no means disposed to sacrifice
their lives without provision being made for themselves and
families in case of a serious issue. They were prevailed upon
by the Governor to return to their posts, and a bounty was
promised them. Bombardment by the French soon afterwards
began, and lasted for two days, occasionally replied to
by the English. But it was not until the evening of the
second day that the first fatality occurred, when one of the
servants was killed, and this brought about a mutiny. Elias
Turner, the chief gunner, declared to his comrades that it was
impossible for the Governor to hold the place and that, for his
part, he was ready to throw himself on the clemency of the
French. Sargeant overhearing this declaration, drew his pistol
and threatened to blow out the gunner's brains if he did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
return to his post, and this form of persuasion proved effective.
The French now profited by the darkness to bring their cannon
through the wood closer to the fort; and by daybreak a
series of heavy balls struck the bastions, causing a breach.
Bridgar and Captain Outlaw, then at Fort Albany, were
convinced that the enemy was undermining the powder
magazine, in which case they would certainly be blown up.</p>

<p>The French from the ship had thrown up a battery, which
was separated from the moat surrounding the fort by less
than a musket shot. None ventured to show himself above
ground at a moment of such peril. A shell exploded at the
head of the stairway and wounded the cook. The cries of
the French could now be distinctly heard outside the fort&mdash;"Vive
le Roi, vive le Roi." In their fright and despair the
English echoed the cry "Vive le Roi," thinking thereby to
propitiate their aggressors. But the latter mistook the cry for
one of defiance, as a token of loyalty to an altogether different
monarch, and the bullets whistled faster and thicker. Sargeant
desired to lower the flag floating above his own dwelling, but
there was none to undertake so hazardous a task. Finally
Dixon, the under-factor, offered to show himself and propitiate
the French. He first thrust a white cloth from a window
and waved a lighted torch before it. He then called in a
loud voice, and the firing instantly ceased. The under-factor
came forth, fully dressed, and bearing two huge flagons of
port wine. Walking beyond the parapets he encountered
both Troyes and Iberville, and by the light of a full moon
the little party of French officers and the solitary Englishman
sat down on the mounted cannon, or on the ground beside
it, broached the two flagons and drank the health of the two
kings, their masters.</p>

<p>"And now, gentlemen," said Dixon, "what is it you want?"</p>

<p>"Possession of your fort in the name of his Most Christian
Majesty, King Lewis XIV."</p>

<p>Dixon, explaining that he was not master there, offered to
conduct this message to Sargeant, and in a very short time the
French commanders were seated comfortably within the house
of the Governor. The demand was again preferred, it being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
added that great offence had been given by the action of the
English in taking captive three French traders, the previous
autumn, and keeping them prisoners on ground owned and
ruled by the King of France. For this reason reparation was
demanded, and Sargeant was desired at once to surrender the
fort. The Governor was surprised at such extreme measures,
for which he was totally unprepared, but was willing to surrender
upon terms of capitulation. On the following morning
these were arranged.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Capitulation
of the fort.</p>

<p>It was agreed that Sargeant should continue to enjoy all
his personal effects; and further, that his deputy, Dixon,
three domestics and his servant, should accompany him out of
the fort. It was also agreed that Troyes should
send the clerks and servants of the Company to
Charlton Island, there to await the arrival of the
Company's ships from England. In case of their non-arrival
within a reasonable time, Troyes promised to assist them
to such vessel as he could command for the purpose. The
Frenchman also gave Sargeant the provisions necessary to
keep him and his companions from starvation. All quitted
the fort without arms, save Sargeant and his son, whose
swords and pistols hung at their sides. The Governor and
his suite were provided with passage to Hays Island, where
he afterwards made his escape to Port Nelson. The others
were distributed between Forts Moose and Albany, and were
treated with considerable severity and hardship.</p>

<p>Having attended to the disposition of his prisoners and their
property, Troyes, accompanied by Iberville, departed on 10th
August for Montreal. The gallant Chevalier and his associates
would have been glad to have pursued their successes,
by crossing the Bay and capturing York Factory. But
although two ships belonging to the Company had fallen to
their lot, yet they could find none competent to command
them. The distance between Albany and Port Nelson was
by water two hundred and fifty leagues, and the road overland
was as yet unknown to the French. But it was not their
purpose that it should long remain so. In a letter to his
official superior at Quebec, Denonville, pursuing his way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
amongst the tribes of the Upper Mississippi region, boasted
that the next year would not pass without their becoming
acquainted with it.</p>

<p>Wherefore Troyes suffered himself to be prevailed upon by
Iberville, and be content with the victories already won.
They carried with them in their journey more than 50,000
beaver as a trophy of their arms. Many of the Hudson's
Bay Company's servants were employed in bearing the spoils.
Along the dreary march several of these unhappy captives
were killed through the connivance of the French with the
Indians; and the survivors reached Quebec in a dreadfully
emaciated and halt condition.</p>

<p>Troyes' victories were ludicrously exaggerated: his return,
therefore, was attended with much pomp.</p>

<p class="sidenote">French
prisoners
taken by the
"Churchill."</p>

<p>Ignorant of Troyes and his conquests, the Company sent
out its annual expedition as usual in 1687. In the autumn of
this year the <i>Churchill</i> was caught in the ice near Charlton
Island. Iberville was quickly apprised of this mishap, and
sent a party of four across the ice to reconnoitre. They appear
to have been somewhat careless, for, while one
sank down from utter exhaustion, the others
were surprised by the Company's crew, seized
and bound. One of the three, however, managed
to escape the fate of his companions,
who were manacled and placed in the bottom of the ship's
hold, where they passed the winter.</p>

<p>But the three Frenchmen enjoyed no monopoly of misfortune.
The captain of the ship, while hunting on the island
in the early days of spring, lost his life by drowning; and
there were numerous minor calamities. In May, preparation
was made for departure, and as the English were short-handed
the two Frenchmen were forced to lend their aid.
This they did willingly, glad to exchange the open air of
heaven for that of the hold of the ship. One day, while most
of the crew were aloft, one of the Frenchmen, perceiving only
two of his captors on deck, furtively secured an axe. With
this implement he silently split the skulls of both men, and
then ran to release his comrade temporarily chained below.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
The pair seized fire-arms which they came upon in a corner
of the hold, and brandishing these in skilful fashion, they
suddenly changed from captives into masters. In opprobrious
terms and with violent gesticulations they dared the
crew to come down from the rigging, or indeed to lay a hand
upon the fringe of a shroud; and while one watched with two
drawn pistols in hand the shivering seamen in the shrouds
and rigging, the other steered the ship towards Rupert's River.
How long this drama might have lasted it is hard to say,
for within a few hours Iberville and his ship hove in sight.
He had fitted out an expedition to rescue his men as soon as
the ice would permit, and now came and took charge of the
<i>Churchill</i> and all on board.</p>

<p class="sidenote">News
of the disaster
reaches
England.</p>

<p>The tidings of this expedition of the Chevalier Troyes,
following close upon the harrowing tale of Smithsend, the
mate of the <i>Merchant of Perpetuana</i>, excited the Adventurers
to a pitch of fury. An extraordinary general
meeting was held and London was placarded
with an account of the outrages. A news-letter
was issued at the Company's expense
detailing the events, and carrying them into the remotest
parts of the kingdom. Lord Churchill, who had succeeded
King James in the governorship of the Company, personally
presented a petition of the outraged Company of Adventurers
to the King, wherein it was prayed "that James would be
pleased to afford them his Royal assistance and Protection
and that Your Majesty will demand and procure satisfaction
to be made them for all losses and damages they have
suffered as well formerly as by this last invasion."</p>

<p>It is now necessary to mention what had been happening
between the two crowns between 1685 and 1688.</p>

<p>In the first named year, in response to the pressure brought
to bear upon both by their subjects, James had agreed with
Lewis to appoint a joint commission to examine into the
disputes between the two nations and, if possible, effect a
pacific settlement.</p>

<p>Their respective possessions in America were giving the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
two Crowns so much trouble and expense that they were
ready to welcome any arrangement which would reduce the
burden. War between England and France in the old days
had been a simple matter, confined to contiguous territory of
whose geography and physical features they knew something.
But now the mother countries could not offer each other hostilities
without a score or so of their offspring colonies springing
at each other's throats.</p>

<p>If war between France and England could only be confined
to war between France and England, and not be allowed to
spread itself over innumerable savage tribes and dependencies
in North America, it was felt that a great end would thereby
be gained.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Negotiations
for Colonial
neutrality.</p>

<p>The point sought by both kings was to make America
neutral. Such a thing would have been excellent, had it
but been possible. But the futility of such an arrangement
was instantly made manifest. Both races in America were
too eager and too anxious to reap the advantages
of war. It was not likely that the
Colonial English would allow a rich prize to
pass them, only to be seized a hundred leagues
farther east by the home authorities. The Colonial French
were not to be expected in time of war to suffer tamely from
competition in the fur-trade, when the very principles of their
allegiance urged them to forcible retaliation.</p>

<p>Even without the episode of the <i>Merchant of Perpetuana</i>
the rivalry between the two nations for the fur-trade was
so bitter as to be a perpetual danger to peace. For this
reason, and in order to mark some delimitation to the trade
of the two countries, the joint commission had sat and
examined into the matter.</p>

<p>On the sixth of November, 1686, a treaty of neutrality had
been concluded between the two kings. It stipulated for a
"firm peace, union and concord, and good understanding
between the subjects" of James and Lewis. No vessels of
either sovereign were thereafter to be employed in attacking
the subjects of the other in any of the colonies. No soldiers
of either king stationed in any of the colonies were to engage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
in any act of hostility such as giving aid or succour to men,
or provisions to savages, at war with one another. But the
fourth article of this treaty was productive of much confusion
and misunderstanding.</p>

<p>"It has been agreed," it ran, "that each of the said kings
shall hold the domains, rights, pre-eminences in the seas,
straits and other waters of America which, and in the same
extent, of right belongs to them; and in the same manner
which they enjoy at present."</p>

<p>Now, at the very moment this treaty was signed, the
French, by the victory of Troyes, were in possession of Fort
Albany and the English still held Port Nelson. As the
liberty of navigation was not disturbed by the Treaty it
would appear that the French retained the right to sail in
the Bay.</p>

<p>Commissioners were appointed to consider the carrying out
of the treaty, the Sieurs Barillon and Bonrepas acting on
behalf of France, and Lords Sutherland, Middleton and
Godolphin for James. To these commissioners the Company
presented a further memorial, which dwelt upon their grievances
"for five years past, in a time of peace and good
correspondence between the two crowns."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Impracticability
of the
Treaty.</p>

<p>These commissioners appear to have done their best to
arrange matters satisfactorily; but such a result was impossible
under the conditions. They were privately instructed
by their respective masters to agree to hold the trade of
Port Nelson in common. Such a proposal was
extremely impracticable, as that well-informed
subject, Denonville, made haste to inform his
royal master. The proximity of the English,
he declared, in such a remote part would be a certain
source of hostility on both sides, and a dangerous temptation
for numbers of "libertines," whom the least dissatisfaction
would induce to take refuge at Port Nelson.</p>

<p>The "libertines" he thus alluded to were the bushrangers,
who were already giving the French great trouble and uneasiness
through their wild, undisciplined habits and their freedom
from restraint. Denonville added that the Hudson's Bay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Company, paying higher prices for beaver than the French
could do, would always have a preference, and consequently
would almost monopolize the trade. It was therefore better,
in his opinion, to effect a compromise in the Bay, restoring
the three forts Troyes had taken in exchange for Port Nelson,
which, so he stated, was worth more than the other three
together for trading purposes. Besides, on the first rupture,
it would be very easy to retake them by an overland march,
as Troyes had done.</p>

<p>But such proposals on the part of the French were indignantly
rejected by the English Company. There was,
therefore, nothing for it but a <i>modus vivendi</i>, under which no
further encroachments in the Bay were to be made by either
party.</p>

<p>But whatever the intent of the negotiations, there was
nothing to compel the parties directly interested to observe
them. The elated French Company was too much inclined to
retain what Troyes had wrested from the English to adhere to
sophistries and weak-kneed arguments. It engaged Iberville
to return to Fort Albany, upon which establishment it had
bestowed the name of St. Anne, and repulse the English
should their ships arrive and endeavour to land. Captain
Moon, returning from Port Nelson, did make an attempt
with twenty-four men to surprise the French. He built a
station some eight miles distant; but Iberville heard of it,
marched thither with great despatch, and pursued them for
twenty miles. He then made preparations for seizing Captain
Moon's ship, embarking upwards of forty men in canoes and
small boats for this purpose. But those aboard her defeated
his intention in the night, by setting her on fire and making
their escape to the shore, where they rejoined their companions
and made the best of their way overland to New
Severn, a fort which had been erected in the previous year as
a means of drawing trade away from the French conquerors
in the eastern parts of the Bay.</p>

<p>Iberville was not long ignorant of the retreat of those who
had escaped him; nor of the prosperity which attended the
new factory. He arrived before New Severn in October, 1689,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
obtained its surrender and took the Company's Governor
prisoner.</p>

<p>Amongst the Governor's papers which he seized was a
letter from the secretary of the Company, ordering him, on
behalf of the partners, to proclaim the Prince and Princess of
Orange King and Queen of England, showing that the chief
spirits of the Company were not unfriendly to those who
precipitated the Revolution.</p>

<p>Glorying in this new exploit, Iberville now returned to
Fort St. Anne, just in time to behold the spectacle of two
strange ships standing off in the Bay.</p>

<p>The presence of these vessels was explained by the Company
having sent out an expedition, comprising eighty-three
men of both crews, with instructions to land on an island
close to the Chechouan River and establish a fort, from
whence they could sally forth to the re-conquest of Fort
Albany. But already the winter had overtaken them, and the
two vessels were locked in the ice. Their fort was, however,
pretty well advanced, and they had landed a number of pieces
of cannon. Iberville lay in ambush and, watching his opportunity,
when twenty-one of the English were proceeding for a
supply of stores to the ship, intercepted them. The whole
party fell into the hands of the French; and Marincourt,
with fourteen men, now began to reconnoitre the forces on the
island. A brisk cannonading ensued between the two parties.
After this had lasted some days Iberville found means to
summon the Company's commander to surrender, threatening
him with no quarter if he deferred compliance.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Surrender of
the Company's
ships to the
French.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Iberville's
treacherous
plan.</p>

<p>To this the Governor responded that he had been given to
understand on his departure from London that there was a
treaty in force between the two Crowns, and that it occasioned
him much astonishment that the French paid so little heed
to it. Iberville's response was not exactly truthful,
for he declared that whether a treaty existed
or not he had not been the first to invade it;
and that in any case he could waste no time in
parley. The Governor replied that his force was still a strong
one; but that he would not be averse to surrender if Iberville
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
would agree to reimburse the Company's officers out of
the proceeds of their store of furs; and also accord them a
vessel wherewith to sail away. This stipulation was granted;
Iberville grimly remarking that it was extraordinary what a
large number of officers there were for so small a company of
men. He had already captured the captain of one of the
vessels and the surgeon; and there now remained thirteen
others who thus escaped scot-free from the clutches of the
French. The amount of wages demanded was close upon
two thousand pounds. All the others were made prisoners,
including the pilots, of whom it is said there were a number
who had been despatched by the Admiralty to acquire a
knowledge of the Bay and Straits. All were carried off by
Iberville to Quebec, and Marincourt left behind with thirty-six
men to guard the two posts. The young commander
did not this time proceed overland, but having got possession
of the Company's ship, the <i>Hampshire</i>, he sailed northward
for the Straits. He had scarcely reached the latitude of
Southampton Island when an English ship hove in sight,
proceeding in his direction. They came so close together
as to exchange speech. Iberville had taken the precaution
to hoist the English flag, and the presence of the
prisoners caused implicit belief in his friendly
pretensions. He learned that young Chouart,
Radisson's nephew, was on board, and declares
that he longed to attack openly the Company's ship, but the
insufficiency of his force to guard the prisoners prevented him
taking this course. He had, however, recourse to a stratagem
which nearly succeeded. The captain of the other ship agreed
to sail together in company through the Straits, and on the
first clear weather to pay a visit to Iberville's ship. It was,
it is almost needless to observe, the Frenchman's intention to
seize the guileless Englishman and his companions the moment
they had reached his deck. But storms intervening, this project
fell through. The ships separated and did not meet
again.</p>

<p>The Hudson's Bay Company was not a little puzzled at the
non-arrival of the <i>Hampshire</i>, which had been spoken thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
happily in Hudson's Straits. For a long time the vessel
was believed to be lost; as, indeed, she was, but not quite
in the manner apprehended by her owners. Possession was
not regained for some years; and when the <i>Hampshire</i>
sailed again for the Bay it was to encounter there complete
destruction in battle.</p>

<p>As has been foreshadowed, in 1689 an event occurred which
had been brewing ever since James had relinquished the
governorship of the Company for the governorship of his
subjects at large. William of Orange landed at Plymouth,
and the Revolution in England put a new king on the
English throne.</p>

</p>

<p>Upon William the Third's accession to the throne, the
Company renewed its claims to its property, and for reparation
for the damages it had suffered at the hands of the
French in time of peace.</p>

<p>"As to the article of the Company's losses, it will appear,"
it said, "by a true and exact estimate, that the French took
from the Company, in full peace between 1682 and 1688,
seven ships with their cargoes, and six forts and factories,
from which they carried away great stores of goods laid
up for trading with the Indians. The whole amounts to
£38,332 15s."</p>

<p>To such effect was this memorial presented to the King
that William caused the hostile proceedings of Lewis in the
Company's territory to be inserted in one of the articles of his
Declaration of War, in these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"But that the French King should invade our Caribbee
Islands and possess himself of our territories of the Province
of New York and Hudson's Bay, in hostile manner, seizing
our forts, burning our subjects' houses and enriching his people
with the spoil of our goods and merchandises, detaining some
of our subjects under the hardships of imprisonment, causing
others to be inhumanly killed, and driving the rest to sea in a
small vessel without food or necessaries to support them, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
actions not even becoming an enemy; and yet he was so far
from declaring himself so, that at that very time he was
negotiating here in England, by his Ministers, a treaty of
neutrality and good correspondence in America."
</p>
</div>

<p>Much has been made by later writers, hostile to the Company,
of a circumstance which soon afterwards took place.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Company's
charter
confirmed.</p>

<p>Owing to the state of public feeling in England towards
the Stewarts at the time of the Revolution, the Company,
keenly alive to the fact of the exiled king's having been so
recently its Governor, sought at the beginning of William's
reign to strengthen its position by an Act of Parliament for the
charter granted by Charles II. Why, have asked its enemies,
if the Company had the utmost confidence in its charter did
it resort to the Lords and Commons to have it confirmed?
And why was this confirmation limited to but seven years?
I have already answered the first question; as
to the second, the Company itself asked for no
longer period. The proceeding was no secret;
it was done openly. Parliament made but one
stipulation, and that at the instance of the Felt-makers'
Company; that the adventurers "should be obliged to make
at least two sales of 'coat beaver' annually, and not exceeding
four. These should be proportioned in lotts of about
£100 sterling each, and not exceeding £200. In the intervals
of public sales the Company should be debarred from
selling beaver by private Contract, or at any price than was
sett up at the last Publick sale."</p>

<p>The Company asked for a confirmation of its charter by
Parliament as a prudent course in uncertain times; and
also in order to more firmly establish its claim to reparation
for damages. The nation's representatives saw no reason
why they should not issue a confirmation; there being none,
save the Felt-makers, to oppose it.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Company
increases its
capital.</p>

<p>The charter being confirmed, it was decided that the nominal
capital of the Company should be increased to £31,500,
several good reasons being put forward in committee for thus
trebling the stock. These reasons are quaintly enumerated
as follows:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p>I&mdash;That the Company have actually in Warehouse above
the value of their first original stock.</p>

<p>II&mdash;That they have set out an Expedition this Yeare in
their Shipps and Cargoe to more than the Value of their
First Stock again; the trading of which Goods may well be
estimated, in expectation as much more.</p>

<p>III&mdash;That our Factories at Port Nelson River and New
Severne are under an increasing Trade; and that
our Returns in Beavers this yeare (by God's
Blessing) are modestly expected to be worth
20,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>IV&mdash;Our Forts, Factories, Guns and other Materials, the
prospect of new Settlements and further Trade, are also
reasonably to be estimated at a considerable intrinsic Value.</p>

<p>V&mdash;And lastly, our just Expectancy of a very considerable
reparation and satisfaction from the French and the close of
this War and the restoring our places and Trade at the
Bottom of the Bay; which upon proof, hath been made out
above 100,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Some years later the Treaty of Ryswick, in securing to the
French the fruits of Iberville's victory, powerfully affected
for ill the fortunes of the Company. Nevertheless, the whole
nation was then in sympathy with its cause, knowing that
but for the continued existence of the Honourable Adventurers
as a body corporate the chances of the western portion
of the Bay reverting to the English were small.</p>

<p>But the Felt-makers were implacable. They would like
to have seen the beaver trade in their own hands. At the
expiration of the seven years for which the confirmation was
allowed, they again, as will be shown, evinced, yet vainly,
their enmity.</p>

<p>Because this parliamentary confirmation was limited to so
short a period, some writers have conjectured that at the
expiration of that period the charter ceased to be valid. So
absurd a conclusion would scarcely appear to stand in need of
refutation. Could those who pretend to draw this inference
have been ignorant that if some of the rights conferred by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
charter required the sanction of Parliament, there were other
rights conferred by it which required no such sanction, because
they were within the prerogative of the Crown? Even assuming
that at the end of the term for which the act of William
and Mary was passed, such of the provisions of the charter (if
there could be found any such) as derived their efficacy only
from parliamentary support should be considered inefficient,
still all the rights similar to those of the charters for former
governments and plantations in America would continue to
exist. That they were so regarded as existing is made
evident by the repeated references to them in various subsequent
international treaties and acts of Parliament. King
George and his advisers completely recognized the Company
as proprietors of a certain domain. In establishing the
limits of the newly-acquired Province of Canada, it was
enacted that it should be bounded on the north by "the
territory granted to the Merchants-Adventurers of England
trading into Hudson's Bay," a boundary which by statute
was long to subsist.</p>

<p>Fort Albany did not prove a success in the hands of the
French. The Quebec Company were losing money, and they
had no ships. They were, besides, severely handicapped by
physical conditions, owing to the inaccessibility of the Bay
by land and the impracticability of carrying merchandise by
the overland route. It seemed clear that, after all, the trade
of the Bay could only be made profitable by sea.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The
French were consequently most anxious to exchange the forts
on James' Bay for Fort Nelson, because they were aware that
better furs were to be had in the north; and because it would
enable them to intercept the tribes who hunted about Lake
Nepigon.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Denonville
plans the
capture of
Fort Nelson.</p>

<p>Denonville is now found writing long despatches to Seignely,
assuring him that their affairs at Hudson's Bay would prosper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
if the Northern Company continued to co-operate with and
second the designs of Iberville, whose fixed resolve was to
go and seize Fort Nelson. For that purpose Denonville
regarded it as necessary that the Minister should inform M.
de Lagny that the King desired the capture of
that fort, and to "furnish Iberville with everything
he requires to render his designs successful."
The Governor himself thought one ship
added to those they had captured in 1689 from
the English would suffice. He sought to obtain for Iberville
some honourable rank in the navy, as this would, he urged,
excite honourable emulation amongst the Canadians who
were ready to follow the sea. Denonville suggested a lieutenancy,
adding his opinion that his young friend was "a very
fine fellow, capable of rendering himself expert and doing
good service." The plea of the Governor was successful and
Lewis was pleased to confer upon Iberville the rank of
lieutenant in the French Royal Navy, the first distinction of
the kind then on record. It fired the blood and pride of not
a few of the Canadian youth, one Peter Gauthier de Varennes
amongst the rest. Many years later he, under the name of
Verandrye, was the first of the great pioneers through the
territories of the Great Company.</p>

<p>All negotiations for an exchange of forts having fallen
through, the <i>Compagnie du Nord</i> determined to make a
valiant attempt to obtain their desires by force. For this
purpose they made powerful application to the Court; and
in the autumn of 1691 their petition resulted in the arrival
at Quebec of Admiral Tast with no fewer than fourteen ships.</p>

<p>It was said in Quebec that while Lewis XIV. surprised his
enemies by his celerity in taking the field in Europe, the
vessels sent out to America by his order always started two
or three months too late for Canada and the Bay. This tardiness,
it was declared, was the sole cause of all the losses and
want of success attending French enterprises in that part of
the New World.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<p>However this may be, there was beyond question another
and not less potent reason for the failure which overtook the
proposed expedition of Tast on behalf of the Northern
Company. Iberville's successes had up to this moment
tended to bolster up the waning popularity of the Company
in Canada. This popular hero had just returned from the
Bay with 80,000 francs value in beaver skins, and 6,000 livres
in small furs, but he now refused point blank to have anything
to do with the expedition. He did not care to share such
glory and profit as he might obtain with his own followers,
with the Company and Admiral Tast.</p>

<p>Without this powerful auxiliary and the support of the
populace, Tast's fleet abandoned its expedition to the Bay,
and sailed away to Acadia and Newfoundland.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Burning of
Fort Nelson.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, while Governor Phipps was in charge of Fort
Nelson this year, a French frigate belonging to the enemy
appeared at the entrance of Bourbon River. As it chanced
that nearly the whole of his garrison were absent from the
fort on a hunting expedition, it seemed to the Governor
that armed resistance would be futile. Rather, therefore, than
allow the fort to pass again into the hands of
the French under circumstances so humiliating,
he resolved to burn it, together with a large part
of its merchandise, valued at about £8,000, well knowing that
without the merchandise the French could not procure furs
from the Indians.</p>

<p>Whilst the flames of the fort were ascending, Phipps and
three men he had with him retreated into ambush and established
themselves with some Indians in the interior.</p>

<p>The Frenchman landed, saw the perdition of his hopes in
the ruin of the fort and its contents, and returned to the ship
with a few hatchets and knives as the sole trophy of his
enterprise.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the Company's ship in the spring however,
York Factory was re-built stronger and on a larger scale than
before.</p>

<p>Iberville at this time finds great cause of complaint in the
fact of the French Company's poverty, and its inability to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
occupy the region after it had been won for them. More than
a single ship was required; and a larger number of men in the
vicinity of Fort Nelson would have served to keep the English
off perpetually.</p>

<p>In 1693 the Northern Company petitioned Pontchartrain,
who had succeeded Seignely at Court, respecting operations
in the Bay. The Company declared that it could hold
everything if it were only enabled to seize Fort Nelson; but
that continued hostilities and losses had so weakened it as
to oblige it to have recourse to his Excellency to obtain
sufficient force in a suitable time to drive out the English.</p>

<p>In another petition it is alleged that this "single fort which
remains in the possession of the English is of so much
importance that the gain or loss of everything in Hudson's
Bay depends upon it. The Company's establishment in
Quebec, to carry on this commerce, claims anew the protection
of your Excellency, that you may give it a sufficient force
to enable it to become master of Fort Nelson, which the
English took by an act of treason against this Company in
time of peace. This they hope from the strong desire which
you have for the aggrandizement of the kingdom, and from
your affection for this colony."</p>

<p>Iberville crossed over to France, and met with a warm
reception at Versailles. He unfolded his plans for the capture
of Fort Nelson, stated what force he would require for this
desirable purpose, and was promised two ships in the following
spring.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Highly gratified with his success, he departed for
home in the <i>Envieux</i>.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">The English
regain
Fort Albany.</p>

<p>The Hudson's Bay Company now made another effort to
regain its fort at Albany. Three powerfully armed ships
wintered at Fort Nelson and sailed thither in the spring of
1693.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> From all accounts that had been received, it was not
believed that the rival French Company was in a position to
maintain a very strong force for an all-winter defence, especially
since the alienation of Iberville. Forty men were
landed, and approaching the post were met by a brisk fire,
which failed to check the English advance. Much to their
own astonishment, they were permitted to close upon the
fort without check, and a ruse was suspected. A cautious
entrance was therefore made: the premises were found
apparently deserted. But at length, in a corner of the
cellar, emaciated and covered with rags, a human being a
victim to scurvy was discovered. His arms and legs were
fastened together, and a heavy chain kept him close to the
wall. While they were marvelling at this
discovery, some of the sailors came to inform
the captain that three Frenchmen had been
seen at a distance flying as fast as their
legs would carry them. Captain Grimington was not long
left in doubt as to the facts: these three Frenchmen had
formed the garrison of the fort St Anne. The unlucky
wretch they now beheld was a bushranger who, in a
paroxysm of rage, had murdered the surgeon at the fort.
Horrified, on recovering his reason, at what he had done,
and fearing that the only witness of the deed, Father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Dalmas, would betray him to the rest, he slew the priest
also. The latter, with his expiring breath, disclosed his
murderer, and the French, then ten in number, had chained
the criminal in the cellar, not themselves relishing the task of
his summary execution.</p>

<p>Iberville did not leave Quebec until the tenth<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of August,
and arrived at Fort Nelson, September 24th. Almost immediately
he disembarked with all his people, also with
cannons, mortars and a large quantity of ammunition.
Batteries were thrown up about five hundred yards from the
palisades, and upon these guns were mounted.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> A bombardment
now took place, lasting from the 25th of September
to the 14th of October, when the governor was forced to
surrender, owing to the danger of a conflagration as well as
to the loss of several of his best men. On this occasion
young Henry Kelsey<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> showed great bravery, and a report
of his gallantry being forwarded to the Company, he was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
presented with the sum of forty pounds as a token of their
appreciation. This youth was destined to be long in the
service of the Company, as first in command at Fort Nelson.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Iberville
takes
Fort Nelson.</p>

<p>Iberville accomplished his entry on the fifteenth of October.
The French standard was hoisted and
the fort christened Bourbon, and it being St.
Theresa's Day, the river was given the name
of that saint. The enemy did not come out of
this business unscathed; they having lost several of their
men, including a brother of Iberville.</p>

<p>Some of the English were kept prisoners, while others
made their way as best they could to New Severn and
Albany. At the time of the surrender, the fort was well
furnished with merchandise and provisions, and this circumstance
induced the French to remain for the winter, before
returning to France.</p>

<p>On the 20th of the following July, Iberville departed for the
straits in his two vessels, the <i>Poli</i> and <i>Salamandre</i>. He left
sixty-seven men under the command of La Forest. Martigny
became lieutenant, and Jérémie was appointed ensign, with the
additional functions of interpreter and "director of commerce."</p>

<p>La Forest and his men were not long to enjoy security
of trade and occupation however. A meeting of the Hudson's
Bay Company was held the moment these outrages were
reported. The King was besought to send a fleet of four
ships to the rescue and recapture of Fort Nelson. But
it was too late to sail that year. News of the proposed
despatch of an English fleet having reached France, Serigny
was sent in June, 1696, with two of the best craft procurable
at Rochelle. Sailing three days before the English,
the two French ships arrived two hours too late. It was
instantly perceived that they were no match for the English,
and accordingly they discreetly withdrew. As the Company's
vessels occupied the mouth of the river, there was no safe
landing place at hand. Both ships set sail again for France;
but one, the <i>Hardi</i>, was destined never to reach her destination.
She probably ran against ice at the mouth of the
straits and went to the bottom with all on board.

<p>The English commenced the attack on the fort August

the French, seeing the strength of their force,
had no alternative but surrender. Perchance
by way of retaliation for the affairs of Albany
and New Severn, the provisions of capitulation<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>

well satisfied with their exploit; but not ignorant of the

</p>

<p>The French prisoners captured in the Company's expedition
of 1696 suffered an incarceration of nearly four months at
Portsmouth. No sooner had their liberty been regained than
they boarded a French brig bound for Havre, and on arrival
in Paris lost little time in making known the condition of
affairs at Hudson's Bay. Lewis and his Ministers, gazing
upon this emaciated band of traders and bushrangers,
could hardly refrain from taking immediate action to retrieve
the situation. Precisely following the tactics of their enemy
in the previous year, they engaged four men-of-war; which
fleet was despatched to join Iberville, then at the port of
Placentia in Newfoundland. The Court was well aware that
there was no one man so thoroughly equipped at all points
in knowledge of the Bay, and the conditions there of life and
warfare, as this hero. Consequently, although numerous
enough, all other offers to lead the expedition were rejected.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the French ships at Placentia, Iberville
took command, embarking in the <i>Pelican</i>, of fifty guns. The
others were the <i>Palmier</i>, the <i>Weesph</i>, the <i>Pelican</i>, and the
<i>Violent</i>.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>But Fort Nelson was not to be captured without a struggle.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Meeting of
the French
and English
ships.</p>

<p>At almost the very moment the French fleet sailed, there
departed from Plymouth four of the Company's ships, the
<i>Hampshire</i>, the <i>Hudson's Bay</i>, the <i>Dering</i>, and <i>Owner's
Love</i>, a fire-ship, the two former having been participants in
the conquest of the previous year. The Company's fleet
entered the straits only forty hours before the ships of the
French; and like them was much impeded by the ice, which
was unusually troublesome. Passage was made by the enemy
in the English wake. The <i>Profound</i>, commanded by Duqué,
pushed past the currents, taking a northerly course, which
brought her commander into full view of two of
the Company's ships. Shots were exchanged;
but owing to the difficulties engendered by the
ice, it was impossible to man&oelig;uvre with such
certainty as to cut off the Frenchman's escape.
While this skirmish was in progress, Iberville in the <i>Pelican</i>
succeeded in getting past the English unknown to them, and
reached the mouth of the Nelson River in sight of the fort.
His presence, as may be imagined, greatly surprised and disturbed
the Governor and the Company's servants; for they
had believed their own ships would have arrived in season to
prevent the enemy from entering the straits. Several rounds
of shot were fired as a signal, in the hope that a response
would be made by the Company's ships which they hourly
expected in that quarter.</p>

<p>On his part the French commander was equally disturbed
by the non-arrival of his three consorts, which the exigencies
of the voyage had obliged him to forsake. Two days were
passed in a state of suspense. At daybreak on the fifth of
September three ships<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> were distinctly visible; both parties
joyfully believed they were their own. So certain was Iberville,
that he immediately raised anchor and started to join
the newcomers. He was soon undeceived, but the perception
of his mistake in no way daunted him.</p>

<p>The Company's commanders were not prepared either for
the daring or the fury of the Frenchman's onslaught. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
true the <i>Pelican</i> was much superior to any of their own craft
singly, being manned by nearly two hundred and fifty men,
and boasting forty-four pieces of cannon. The Company's
ships lined up, the <i>Hampshire</i> in front, the <i>Dering</i> next, with
the <i>Hudson's Bay</i> bringing up the rear.</p>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">A fierce
battle in
the Bay.</p>

<p>The combatants being in close proximity the battle began
at half-past nine in the morning. The French commander
came straight for the <i>Hampshire</i>, whose captain, believing
it was his enemy's design to board, instantly lowered his
mainsheet and put up his fore-top-sail. Contact having been
by these means narrowly evaded, the scene of battle suddenly
shifted to the <i>Pelican</i> and the <i>Dering</i>, whose
mainsail was smitten by a terrific volley. At
the same time the <i>Hudson's Bay</i>, veering, received
a damaging broadside. The Company's
men could distinctly hear the orders shouted by Iberville to
both ships to discharge a musket fire into the <i>Dering's</i> forecastle,
but in this move he was anticipated by the English
sailors, who poured a storm of bullets in upon the Frenchman,
accompanied by a broadside of grape, which wrought havoc
with her sails. While the cries of the wounded on the <i>Pelican</i>
could be distinctly heard, all three of the Company's ships
opened fire, with the design of disabling her rigging. But the
captain of the <i>Hudson's Bay</i>, seeing that he could not engage
the <i>Pelican</i>, owing to Iberville's tactics, determined to run
in front of her and give her the benefit of a constant hull
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
fire, besides taking the wind from her sails. Iberville
observed the movement; the two English vessels were near;
he veered around, and by a superb piece of seamanship came
so near to the <i>Hampshire</i> that the crew of the latter saw that
boarding was intended. Every man flew out on the main
deck, with his pistol and cutlass, and a terrific broadside of
grape on the part of the Englishman alone saved him.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0174" id="im_0174"></a>
<img src="images/im_0174.jpg" width="550" height="376" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Evacuation of Fort Nelson.</span><br />
(<i>See page <a href="#Page_166">166</a>.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The battle raged hotter and fiercer. The <i>Hampshire's</i>
salvation had been only temporary; at the end of three hours
and a half she began to sink, with all sails set. When this
occurred, Iberville had ninety men wounded, forty being
struck by a single broadside. Notwithstanding this, he
decided at once to push matters with the <i>Hampshire's</i>
companions, although the <i>Pelican</i> was in a badly damaged
state, especially the forecastle, which was a mass of
splinters.</p>

<p>The enemy made at once for the <i>Dering</i>, which, besides
being the smallest ship, had suffered severely. She crowded
on all sail and managed to avoid an encounter, and Iberville
being in no condition to prosecute the chase, returned to the
<i>Hudson's Bay</i>, which soon surrendered. Iberville was not destined,
however, to reap much advantage from his prize, the
<i>Hampshire</i>. The English flag-ship was unable to render any
assistance to her and she soon went down with nearly all on
board.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>To render the situation more distressing, no sooner had
some ninety prisoners been made, than a storm arose; so
that it became out of the question to approach the shore
with design of landing. They were without a long-boat
and each attempt to launch canoes in the boiling surf was
attended with failure.</p>

<p class="sidenote">A great
storm.</p>

<p>Night fell; the wind instead of calming, grew fiercer. The
sea became truly terrible, seeking, seemingly, with all its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
power to drive the <i>Pelican</i> and the <i>Hudson's Bay</i> upon
the coast. The rudders of each ship broke;
the tide rose and there seemed no hope for
the crews whose destiny was so cruel. Their
only hope in the midst of the bitter blast and clouds of snow
which environed them, lay in the strength of their cables.
Soon after nine o'clock the <i>Hudson's Bay</i> and its anchor
parted with a shock.</p>

<p>"Instantly," says one of the survivors, "a piercing cry went
up from our forecastle. The wounded and dead lay heaped
up, with so little separation one from the other that silence
and moans alone distinguished them. All were icy cold, and
covered with blood. They had told us the anchor would
hold; and we dreaded being washed up on the shore stiff
the next morning."</p>

<p>A huge wave broke over the main deck and the ship
rocked desperately. Two hours later the keel was heard to
split, and the ship was hurled rudderless to and fro in the
trough of the sea.</p>

<p>By the French account, matters were in no more enviable
state aboard the <i>Pelican</i>; Iberville, however, amidst scenes
rivalling those just described, did his best to animate his
officers and men with a spirit equalling his own.</p>

<p>"It is better," he cried, "to die, if we must, outside the
bastions of Fort Bourbon than to perish here like pent sheep
on board."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Terrible
plight of the
shipwrecked
French.</p>

<p>When morning broke, it was seen by the French that their
ship was not yet submerged, and it was resolved to disembark
by such means as lay in their power. The Company's
servants were more fortunate. The <i>Hudson's Bay</i> had drifted
eight miles to the south of the fort, and was wrecked on a
bank of icy marshland, which at least constrained
them to wade no deeper than their
knees. The French, however, were forced to
make their way through the icy water submerged
to their necks, from the results of which
terrible exposure no fewer than eighteen marines and seamen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
lost their lives. Once on shore they could not, like the
English, look forward to a place of refuge and appease their
hunger with provisions and drink. They were obliged, in
their shivering, half frozen state, to subsist upon moss and
seaweed, but for which indifferent nourishment they must
inevitably have perished.</p>

<p>The Company's garrison witnessed the calamities which
were overtaking the French, but not knowing how great their
number, and assured of their hostility, did not attempt any
acts of mercy. They perceived the enemy camped in a wood,
less than two leagues distant, where, building several large fires
they sought to restore their spirits by means of warmth and
hot draughts of boiled herbs.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0177" id="im_0177"></a>
<img src="images/im_0177.jpg" width="398" height="398" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"The enemy camped in a wood where,
building several large fires, they
sought to restore their spirits."</p>
</div>

<p>While the fort was being continually recruited by survivors
of the two wrecked ships, the other three French vessels had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
arrived on the scene. The fourth, the <i>Violent</i>, lay at the bottom
of the Bay, having been sunk by the ice. The <i>Palmier</i>
had suffered the loss of her helm, but was fortunate in
not being also a victim of the storm. The French forces
being now united, little time was lost by Iberville in
making active preparations for the attack upon the fort.</p>

<p>On the 11th, the enemy attained a small wood, almost
under the guns of the fort, and having entrenched themselves,
lit numerous fires and made considerable noise in order to
lend the impression to the English that an entrenchment was
being thrown up. This ruse was successful, for the Governor
gave orders to fire in that direction; and Iberville, seizing
this opportunity, effected a landing of all his men and
armaments from the ships.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Iberville
demands
surrender of
the fort.</p>

<p>The fort would now soon be hemmed in on all sides, and it
were indeed strange if a chance shot or fire-brand did not
ignite the timbers, and the powder magazine were not exploded.
Governor Bailey was holding a council of his advisers
when one of the French prisoners in the fort gave notice of
the approach of a messenger bearing a flag of truce. He
was recognized as Martigny. The Governor permitted his
advance, and sent a factor to meet him and insist upon his
eyes being bandaged before he would be permitted to enter.
Martigny was conducted to where the council
was sitting and there delivered Iberville's message,
demanding surrender. He was instantly
interrupted by Captain Smithsend, who, with a
great show of passion, asked the emissary if it
were not true that Iberville had been killed in the action. In
spite of Martigny's denials, Smithsend loudly persisted in believing
in Iberville's death; and held that the French were in
sore straits and only made the present attack because no other
alternative was offered to desperate men to obtain food and
shelter. Bailey allowed himself to be influenced by Smithsend,
and declined to yield to any of Martigny's demands.
The latter returned, and the French instantly set up a battery
near the fort and continued, amidst a hail of bullets, the work
of landing their damaged stores and armaments. Stragglers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
from the wreck of the <i>Hudson's Bay</i> continued all day to find
their way to the fort, but several reached it only to be shot
down in mistake by the cannon and muskets of their own
men. On the 12th, after a hot skirmish, fatal to both sides,
the Governor was again requested, this time by Sérigny, to
yield up the fort to superior numbers.</p>

<p>"If you refuse we will set fire to the place, and accord
you no quarter," was the French ultimatum.</p>

<p>"Set fire and be d&mdash;&mdash;d to you!" responded Bailey.</p>

<p>He then set to work, with Smithsend, whose treatment at
the hands of the French in the affair of the <i>Merchant of
Perpetuana</i> was still vividly before him, to animate the
garrison.</p>

<p>"Go for them, you dogs!" cried Bailey, "Give it to them
hot and heavy; I promise you forty pounds apiece for your
widows!"</p>

<p>Fighting in those days was attended by fearful mortality,
and the paucity of pensions to the hero's family, perhaps,
made the offer seem handsome. At any rate it seemed a
sufficient incentive to the Company's men, who fought like
demons.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>A continual fire of guns and mortars, as well as of muskets,
was kept up. The Canadians sallied out upon a number of
skirmishes, filling the air with a frightful din, borrowing from
the Iroquois their piercing war-cries. In one of these sallies
St. Martin, one of their bravest men, perished.</p>

<p>Under protection of a flag of truce, Sérigny came again to
demand a surrender. It was the last time, he said, the request
would be preferred. A general assault had been resolved
upon by the enemy, who were at their last resort, living like
beasts in the wood, feeding on moss, and to whom no
extremity could be odious were it but an exchange for their
present condition. They were resolved upon carrying the fort,
even at the point of the bayonet and over heaps of their slain.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>

<p>Bailey decided to yield. He sent Morrison to carry
the terms of capitulation, in which he demanded all the
peltries in the fort belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company.
This demand being rejected by the enemy, Bailey later in
the evening sent Henry Kelsey with a proposition to retain
a portion of their armament; this also was refused. There
was now nothing for it but to surrender, Iberville having
granted an evacuation with bag and baggage.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Evacuation of
the English.</p>

<p>At one o'clock on the following day, therefore, the evacuation
took place. Bailey, at the head of his garrison and a
number of the crew of the wrecked <i>Hudson's Bay</i>, and six
survivors of the <i>Hampshire</i>, marched forth from
Fort York with drums beating, flag flying, and
with arms and baggage. They hardly knew
whither they were to go; or what fate awaited them. A vast
and inhospitable region surrounded them, and a winter long
to be remembered for its severity had begun. But to the
French it seemed as if their spirits were undaunted, and
they set forth bravely.</p>

<p>The enemy watched the retreat of the defeated garrison
not without admiration, and for the moment speculation was
rife as to their fate. But it was only for the moment. Too
rejoiced to contemplate anything but the termination of their
own sufferings, the Canadians hastened to enter the fort,
headed by Boisbriant, late an ensign in the service of the
Compagnie du Nord. Fort Nelson was once more in the
hands of the French.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

Petition Presented to Parliament Hostile to Company&mdash;Seventeenth

of Trade Prescribed&mdash;Company's Conservatism&mdash;Letters
to Factors&mdash;Character of the Early Governors&mdash;Henry Kelsey&mdash;York

</p>

<p>Before the news of the catastrophe could reach England,
in April, 1698, there was presented to Parliament a petition
appealing against the confirmation of the privileges and trade
granted to the Company in 1690.</p>

<p>The principal reason alleged for this action was the exorbitant
price of beaver which it was contended turned away
an immense amount of Indian trade, which reverted to the
French in Canada.</p>

<p>Another reason given was the undesirable monopoly which
caused English dealers, while paying the highest prices for
beaver, to get the worst article; the best travelling to Russia
and other continental countries. In this petition, concocted
by enemies of the Company envious of its success, it was
insinuated that the Company's trade had been of no use save
to increase the practice of stock-jobbing.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Company
replies to its
enemies.</p>

<p>To this the Company made reply that "it was well known
that the price of beaver had decreased one-third since its own
establishment; and that themselves, far from
hindering the trade, encouraged it by every
means in their power, being anxious to be
relieved of an over-stocked commodity." Herein
they referred to the enormous quantity of furs stored in their
warehouse, for which, during the stringency of continued
trade they were obliged to retain and pay repeated taxes
upon.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> As for sending goods to Russia it was only of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
late years that the Company had extended its trade to that
and other foreign countries and for no other cause than
that reasonable prices could not be obtained in England.</p>

<p>Although two London guilds, the Skinner's Company and
the Felt-makers' Company, joined issue with the Honourable
Adventurers, the fate of the petition was sealed. On account
of the misfortunes which had overtaken the Company,
together with the presence of other and weightier matters,
for Parliamentary consideration, the petition was laid on the
table, and from the table it passed to the archives, where,
together with the Act of 1690, it lay forgotten for a century
and a half.</p>

<p>It will be diverting, at this juncture in the general narrative,
to glance at seventeenth century conditions of life and commerce
in the domain of the Company.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Method of
trade with the
Indians.</p>

<p>Even at so early a period as 1690 was the method of transacting
trade with the Indians devised and regulated. The
tribes brought down their goods, beaver skins, martens, foxes
and feathers, to the Factory and delivered them through a
small aperture in the side of the storehouse. They entered
the stockade three or four at a time; trading one by one at
the window over which presided the traders. The whole of
the actual trading of the Factory was in the
hands of two officials known as traders. None
other of the Company's servants at any fort
were permitted to have direct intercourse with
the Indians, save in exceptional circumstances. The trade
was chiefly carried on in summer when the rivers were free
from ice, although occasionally the natives in the immediate
region of the factories came down in winter; the factors
never refusing to trade with them when they so came. No
partiality was shown to particular tribes, but the actual
hunters were favoured more than those who merely acted
as agents or carriers. It was not unusual for the chief
factors, as the Governors came to be called after 1713,
to make presents to the chiefs in order to encourage them
to bring down as many of their tribe the ensuing year as
possible.

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Trading with the Indians.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Before the era of the standard of trade, it was customary
at all the forts, as it was at one or two long afterwards, for
remuneration for the furs of the savages to be left at the chief
factor's discretion. Many things conspired to alter the values
from season to season, and even from day to day, but no
cause was so potent as the contiguous rivalry of the French.
When the French were close at hand in the vicinity of Fort
Nelson, as they were from 1686 to 1693, the price of beaver
would fluctuate with surprising rapidity. It should be borne
in mind that the western country at this period, and for long
afterwards, was frequented by roving, adventurous parties of
<i>coureurs des bois</i>, whose activity in trade tended to injure the
Company's business. Even an enactment prescribing death
for all persons trading in the interior of the country without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
a license, had proved insufficient to abate their numbers or
their activity.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Activity of
"coureurs des
bois."</p>

<p>The Hudson's Bay Company seem to have some cognizance
of this state of affairs, and were wont to put down
much of the depredations it suffered at the hands of the
French to the unkempt multitude of bushrangers. In one
document it describes them as "vagrants," and La Chesnaye,
who had been the leading spirit of the Quebec Company, was
ready to impute to them much of the woes of the fur-trade,
as well as the greater part of the unpleasant rivalries which
had overtaken the French and their neighbours. One day
it would be carried like wild-fire amongst the tribe who
had come to barter, that the French were giving a pound of
powder for a beaver; that a gun could be bought from the
English for twelve beaver. In an instant there was a stampede
outside the respective premises, and a rush would be
made for the rival establishment. Fifty miles for a single
pound of powder was nothing to these Indians,
who had often journeyed two whole months in
the depth of winter, endured every species of toil
and hardship in order to bring down a small
bundle of peltries; nor when he presented himself at the
trader's window was the Indian by any means sure what
his goods would bring. He delivered his bundles first, and the
trader appraised them and gave what he saw fit. If a series
of wild cries and bodily contortions ensued, the trader was
made aware that the Indian was dissatisfied with his bargain,
and the furs were again passed back through the aperture.
This was merely a form; for rarely did the native make a
practical repentance of his bargain, however unsatisfactory it
might appear to him. It is true the Indian was constant in his
complaint that too little was given for his furs; but no matter
what the price had been this would have been the case.
Apart from dissatisfaction being an ineradicable trait in the
Indian character, the contemplation of the sufferings and
privations he had undergone to acquire his string of beads,
his blanket, or his hatchet, must have aroused in him all his
fund of pessimism.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>In 1676 the value of the merchandise exported did not
exceed £650 sterling. The value of the furs imported was
close upon £19,000.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A "Coureur des Bois."</span></p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">Prices paid
for furs.</p>

<p>In 1678 the first standard was approved of by the Company
on the advice of one of its governors, Sargeant, but it does not
appear to have been acted upon for some years. The actual
tariff was not fixed and settled to apply to any but Albany fort,
and a standard was not filed at the Council of Trade until
1695. It originally covered forty-seven articles, later increased
to sixty-three, and so remained for more than half a century.
At first, as has been noted in an earlier chapter, the aborigines
were content with beads and toys, and no doubt the bulk of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
the supplies furnished them might have continued for a much
longer period to consist of these baubles and petty luxuries
had not the policy of the Company been to enrich the
Indians (and themselves) with the arms and implements
of the chase. Gradually the wants of the savages became
wider, so that by the time, early in the eighteenth century,
the French had penetrated into the far western country,
these wants comprised many of the articles in common
use amongst civilized people. The standard of trade alluded
to was intended to cover the relative values at each of
the Company's four factories. Yet the discrepancy existing
between prices at the respective establishments was small.
In 1718 a blanket, for example, would fetch
six beavers at Albany and Moose, and seven
at York and Churchill. In nearly every case
higher prices were to be got from the tribes
dealing at York and Churchill than from those at the other
and more easterly settlements, often amounting to as much as
thirty-three per cent. This was illustrated in the case of
shirts, for which three beavers were given in the West
Main, and only a single beaver at East Main. The
Company took fifteen beavers for a gun; whereas, when
Verandrye appeared, he was willing to accept as small a
number as eight. Ten beavers for a gun was the usual price
demanded by the French. It may be observed that a distinguishing
feature of the French trade in competition with
the Company was that they dealt almost exclusively in light
furs, taking all of that variety they could procure, the Indians
bringing to the Company's settlements all the heavier furs,
which the French refused at any price, owing to the difficulty
of land transportation. These difficulties, in the case of the
larger furs, were so great that it is related that upon innumerable
occasions the savages themselves, when weakened by
hunger, used to throw overboard all but mink, marten and
ermine skins rather than undergo the painful labour of
incessant portages.</p>

<p>It must not be inferred, however, that the factors ever
adhered strictly in practice to the standard prescribed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
regulated from time to time by the Company. The standard
was often privately doubled, where it could be done prudently,
so that where the Company directed one skin to be taken for
such or such an article, two were taken. The additional profit
went into the hands of the chief factor, and a smaller share to
the two traders, without the cognizance of the Company, and
was called the overplus trade.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Stationary
character of
the Company's
trade.</p>

<p>Occasionally, far seeing, active spirits amongst its servants
strove to break through the policy of conservatism which
distinguished its members; but where they succeeded it was
only for a short period; and the commerce of the corporation
soon reverted to its ancient boundaries. But this apparent
attitude is capable of explanation. The Company
were cognizant, almost from the first, that
the trade they pursued was capable of great
extension. One finds in the minute-books,
during more than forty years from the time of
Radisson and Groseilliers, partner after partner arising in
his place to enquire why the commerce, vastly profitable
though it was, remained stationary instead of increasing.</p>

<p>"Why are new tribes not brought down? Why do not our
factors seek new sources of commerce?" A motion directing
the chief factor to pursue a more active policy was often put
and carried. But still the trade returns, year after year,
remained as before. Scarce a season passed without exhortations
to its servants to increase the trade. "Use more
diligence," "prosecute discoveries," "draw down distant
tribes," form the burden of many letters.</p>

<p>"We perceive," writes the Company's secretary in 1685 to
Sargeant, "that our servants are unwilling to travel up into
the country by reason of danger and want of encouragement.
The danger, we judge, is not more now than formerly; and for
their encouragement we shall plentifully reward them, when
we find they deserve it by bringing down Indians to our
factories, of which you may assure them. We judge Robert
Sandford a fit person to travel, having the linguæ and understanding
the trade of the country; and upon a promise of
Mr. Young (one of our Adventurers) that he should travel, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
which reason we have advanced his wages to £30 per annum,
and Mr. Arrington, called in the Bay, Red-Cap, whom we
have again entertained in our service; as also John Vincent,
both which we do also judge fit persons for you to send up
into the country to bring down trade." To this the Governor
replied that Sandford was by no means disposed to accept
the terms their Honours proposed, but rather chose to go
home. "Neither he nor any of your servants will travel up
the country, although your Honours have earnestly desired it,
and I pressed it upon those proposals you have hinted."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Character of
the Company's
Factors.</p>

<p>I have already shown why the Company's wishes in this
respect were not fruitful; that the character of the men in the
Company's employ was not yet adapted to the work in hand.
Its servants were not easily induced to imperil their lives;
they gained little in valour or hardihood from
their surroundings. They were shut up in the
forts, as sailors are shut up in a ship, scarcely
ever venturing out in winter, and hardly ever
holding converse with a savage in his wild state. In vain,
for the most part, were such men stirred to enterprise;
and so this choice and habit of seclusion grew into a rule
with the Company's employees; and the discipline common
to the ship, or to contracted bodies, became more and more
stringent. The Company's policy was nearly always dictated
by the advice of their factors, but it can be shown that these
were not always wise, dreading equally the prospect of leading
an expedition into the interior, and the prestige which
might ensue if it were entrusted to a subordinate.</p>

<p>A discipline ludicrous when contrasted with the popular
impression regarding the fur-trader's career, was maintained
in the early days. It was the discipline of the quarter-deck,
and surprised many of the youth who had entered the Company's
employ expecting a life of pleasure and indulgence.
Many of the governors were resembled, Bridgar and Bailey
being surly, violent men, and were, indeed, often chosen for
these qualities by the Company at home.</p>

<p>It is singular but true, that in the days of our ancestors a
choleric temper was considered an unfailing index of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
masterful man. In both branches of the King's service,
on sea and on land, there seemed to have been no surer sign
of a man's ability to govern and lead, than spleen and
tyranny; and many an officer owed his promotion and won
the regard of the Admiralty and the War Office by his
perpetual exhibition of the traits and vices of the martinet.
One of the Company's governors, Duffell, was wont to order
ten lashes to his men on the smallest provocation. Another
named Stanton, the governor at Moose Factory, declared he
would whip any man, even to the traders, without trial if he
chose; and this declaration he more than once put into practice.
The whipping of two men, Edward Bate and Adam
Farquhar, at Moose Factory, almost occasioned a mutiny
there. The death of one Robert Pilgrim, from a blow
administered by the chief factor, created a scandal some years
later in the century. It was the practice of the early governors
to strike the Indians when they lost their own tempers
or for petty offences.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Life at the
Company's
factories.</p>

<p>It is diverting to compare nineteenth century life at the
factories, on its religious, moral and intellectual side, to what
obtained in the early days. In Governor Stanton's time, out
of thirty-six men only six were able to read. There was
neither clergyman nor divine worship. The men passed their
time in eating and sleeping. Occasionally,
Indian squaws were smuggled into the fort,
at the peril of the governor's displeasure, for
immoral purposes. The displeasure of the
governor was not, however, excited on the grounds of morality,
for it was nearly always the case that the governor had
a concubine residing on the premises or near at hand; and it
was observed in 1749 by a servant of thirty years' standing in
the Company's employ, that at each fort most of the half-breed
children in the country claimed paternity of the one or
other of the factors of the Company.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">An Early River Pioneer.</span></p>
</div>

<p>To return to the question of the extension of trade, there
were from time to time governors and servants who evinced
a zeal and love for adventure which contrasted favourably
with that of their fellows. Their exploits, however, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
compared with those of the hardier race of French-Canadian
bushrangers were tame enough. In 1673 Governor Bailey
summoned all the servants of the fort to appear before him,
and informed them that it was the Company's wish that some
amongst them should volunteer to find out a site for a new
fort. Three young men presented themselves, two of whom
afterwards became governors of the Company. The names of
these three were William Bond, Thomas Moore and George
Geyer. Some years later Bond was drowned in the Bay; but
his two companions continued for some years to set an example
which was never followed; and of which they seem finally
to have repented. Indeed, almost without exception, once
a fort was built the servants seem to have clung closely to it;
and it was not until the year 1688 that a really brave, adventurous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
figure, bearing considerable resemblance to the bushrangers
of the past, and the explorers of the future, emerges
into light.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Kelsey's
Voyage.</p>

<p>Henry Kelsey, a lad barely eighteen years of age, was the
forerunner of all the hardy British pioneers of the ensuing
century. He is described as active, "delighting much in
Indians' company; being never better pleased than when he
is travelling amongst them." Young as he was, Kelsey
volunteered to find out a site for a fort on
Churchill River. No record exists of this voyage;
but a couple of years later he repeated it,
and himself kept a detailed diary of his tour.</p>

<p>In this journal the explorer states that he received his
supplies on the 5th of July, 1691. He sent the Assiniboines
ten days before him, and set out for Dering's Point to seek
the remainder of their tribe. At this place it was the custom
for the Indians to assemble when they went down the coast
on trading expeditions. Kelsey soon overtook them, and
accompanied them to the country of the Naywatamee Poets,
the journey consuming fifty-nine days. He travelled first by
water seventy-one miles from Dering's Point, and there
beached his canoes and continued by land a distance of
three hundred and sixteen miles, passing through a wooded
country. At the end of this came prairie lands for forty-six
miles, intersected by a small shallow river scarcely a hundred
yards wide. Crossing ponds, woods and champaign for
eighty-one miles more, discovering many buffalo and beavers,
the young explorer retraced his steps fifty-four miles, and
there met the tribe of which he was in search. Kelsey did
not accomplish this journey without meeting with many
adventures. On one occasion the Naywatamee Poets left him
asleep on the ground. During his slumber the fire burnt the
moss upon which he was lying and entirely consumed the
stock of his gun, for which he was obliged to improvise from
a piece of wood half dry. On another occasion, he and an
Indian were surprised by a couple of grisly bears. His companion
made his escape to a tree, while Kelsey, his retreat cut
off, hid himself in a clump of high willows. The bears perceiving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
the Indian in the branches made directly for him, but
Kelsey observing their action levelled his gun and killed one
of the animals, the other bear bounding towards the place from
which the shots came, and not finding the explorer, returned
to the tree, when he was brought down by Kelsey's second
shot. Good fortune attended this exploit, for it attained for
the young man the name among the tribes of Miss-top-ashish,
or "Little Giant." He returned to York Factory after this
first expedition, apparelled after the manner of his Indian
companions, while at his side trudged a young woman with
whom he had gone through the ceremony of marriage after
the Indian fashion. It was his wish that Mistress Kelsey
should enter with her husband into the court, but this desire
quickly found an opponent in the Governor, whose scruples,
however, were soon undermined when the explorer flatly
declined to resume his place and duties in the establishment
unless his Indian wife were admitted with him.</p>

<p>Thus, then, it is seen that in 1691, forty years before Verandrye's
voyages of discovery, this young servant of the
Hudson's Bay Company, had penetrated to no slight extent
into the interior. He had crossed the Assiniboine country,
seen for the first time among the English and French the
buffaloes of the plain, he had been attacked by the grisly
bears which belong to the far west; and in behalf of the
Hudson's Bay Company had taken possession of the lands
he traversed, and secured for his masters the trade of the
Indians hitherto considered hostile.</p>

<p>Although the Governor hoped that the encouragement
noted in the case of Kelsey, together with the advance of
salary, would stimulate other young men to follow his
example, yet, strange to say, none came forward. The day
of the Henrys, the Mackenzies, the Thompsons and the
Frobishers had not yet dawned.</p>

<p>For many years after this the Company was in constant
apprehension that its profits would be curtailed by tribal
wars.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Effect of
Indian wars
on the
Company's
business.</p>

<p>"Keep the Indians from warring with one another, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
they may have more time to look after their trade," was a
frequently repeated injunction. "If you prevent
them from fighting they will bring a larger
quantity of furs to the Factory," they wrote on
one occasion to Geyer. The Governor admitted
the premise, "but," said he, "perhaps your
Honours will tell me how I am going to do it." The
Company devoted a whole meeting to consider the matter,
and decided that nothing was easier, provided their instructions
were implicitly obeyed.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0195" id="im_0195"></a>
<img src="images/im_0195.jpg" width="404" height="272" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fac-Simile of Company's Standard of Trade.</span></p>
</div>

<p>"Tell them what advantages they may make," they wrote;
"that the more furs they bring, the more goods they will be
able to purchase of us, which will enable them to live more
comfortably and keep them from want in a time of scarcity.
Inculcate better morals than they yet understand; tell them
that it doth nothing advantage them to kill and destroy one
another, that thereby they may so weaken themselves that
the wild ravenous beasts may grow too numerous for them,
and destroy them that survive." If Geyer delivered this message
to the stern and valorous chiefs with whom he came in
contact, they must have made the dome of heaven ring with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
scornful laughter. He was obliged to write home that fewer
savages had come down than in former seasons because they
expected to be attacked by their enemies. The Company
then responded shortly and in a business-like manner, that if
fair means would not prevail to stop these inter-tribal conflicts,
that the nation beginning the next quarrel was not to
be supplied for a year with powder or shot "which will
expose them to their enemies, who will have the master of
them and quite destroy them from the earth, them and their
wives and children. This," adds the secretary, and in a spirit
of true prophecy, "must work some terror amongst them."</p>

<p class="sidenote">The French
at Michilimackinac.</p>

<p>A potent cause contributed to the lack of prosperity which
marked Port Nelson under the French <i>régime</i>. It was the
exploitation of the west by an army of traders
and bushrangers. The new post of Michilimackinac
had assumed all the importance as a
fur-trading centre which had formerly belonged
to Montreal. The French, too, were served by capable
and zealous servants, none more so than Iberville himself,
the new Governor of the Mississippi country.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> His
whole ambition continued to be centred upon driving out the
English from the whole western and northern region, and
destroying forever their trade and standing with the aborigines,
and none more than he more ardently desired the
suppression of the <i>coureur de bois</i>. "No Frenchmen," he
declared, "should be allowed to follow the Indians in their
hunts, as it tends to keep them hunters, as is seen in Canada;
and when they are in the woods they do not desire to become
tillers of the soil."</p>

<p>At the same time the value of the bushrangers to the
French <i>régime</i> was considerable in damaging the English on
the Bay.</p>

<p>"It is certain," observed one of their defenders, "that if
the articles required for the upper tribes be not sent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Michilimackinac, the Indians will go in search of them to
Hudson's Bay, to whom they will convey all their peltries,
and will detach themselves entirely from us."</p>

<p>The bushrangers penetrated into the wilderness and intercepted
the tribes, whose loyalty to the English was not proof
against liquor and trinkets served on the spot, for which
otherwise they would have to proceed many weary leagues
to the Bay.</p>

<p>The Company began to experience some alarm at the
fashion the trade was sapped from their forts at Albany
and Moose.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The Quebec Company was in the same plight
with regard to Port Nelson.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Western
Company.</p>

<p>An association of French merchants, known as the Western
Company, sprang up in the early days of the eighteenth century
and many forts and factories were built in the Mississippi
region. Its promoters expected great results from a new skin
until now turned to little account, that of bison,
great herds of which animal had been discovered
roaming the western plains. M. de Juchereau,
with thirty-four Canadians, established a post on the Wabash,
in the name of the Western Company. Here, he writes,
he collected in a short time fifteen thousand buffalo skins.</p>

<p>From 1697 to 1708 a series of three commandants were
appointed, one of whom now administered the affairs at Fort
Bourbon, which however never assumed the importance which
had attached to it under the English rule.</p>

<p>There is one romantic episode which belongs to this period,
serving to relieve by its vivid, perhaps too vivid, colouring, the
long sombreness of the French <i>régime</i>. It was the visit in
1704 of an officer named Lagrange and his suite from France.
In the train of this banished courtier came a number of
gallant youths and fair courtesans; and for one brief season
Fort Bourbon rang with laughter and revelry. Hunting
parties were undertaken every fine day; and many trophies of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
the chase were carried back to France. Have ever the generations
of quiet English servants and Scotch clerks snatched
a glimpse, in their sleeping or waking dreams, of those mad
revels, a voluptuous scene amidst an environment so sullen
and sombre?</p>

<p>In the year 1707 Jérémie, the lieutenant, obtained permission
of the Company to return to France on leave. He
succeeded in obtaining at court his nomination to the post of
successor to the then commandant, Delisle. After a year's
absence he returned to Port Nelson, to find matters in a
shocking state. No ships had arrived from France, and stores
and ammunition were lacking. A few days after his arrival,
Delisle was taken seriously ill, and expired from the effects of
cold and exposure.</p>

<p>For a period of six years Jérémie continued to govern Fort
Bourbon, receiving his commission not from the Company
but direct from the King himself, a fact of which he seems
very proud.</p>

<p>Jérémie's tenure of office was marked by a bloody affair,
which fortunately had but few parallels under either English
or French occupation. Although the tribes in the neighbourhood
were friendly and docile, they were still capable, upon
provocation, to rival those Iroquois who were a constant
source of terror to the New England settlers.</p>

<p>In August, 1708, Jérémie sent his lieutenant, two traders
and six picked men of his garrison to hunt for provisions.
They camped at nightfall near a band of savages who had
long fasted and lacked powder, which, owing to its scarcity,
the French did not dare give them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Indian
Treachery.</p>

<p>Round about these unhappy savages, loudly lamenting the
passing of the English dominion when powder and shot was
plenty, were the heaps of furs which to them were useless.
They had journeyed to the fort in all good faith, across
mountain and torrent, as was their custom, only to find their
goods rejected by the white men of the fort, who told them to
wait. When the French hunting party came to encamp near
them, several of the younger braves amongst the Indians
crept up to where they feasted, and returned with the news
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
to their comrades. The tribe was fired with resentment.
Exasperated by the cruelty of their fate, they hatched a plan
of revenge and rapine. Two of their youngest and comeliest
women entered the assemblage of the white men, and by
seductive wiles drew two of them away to their own lodges.
The remaining six, having eaten and drunk their fill, and
believing in their security, turned to slumber. Hardly had
the two roysterers arrived at the Indian camp than instead of
the cordial privacy they expected, they were confronted by
two score famished men drawn up in front of the
lodges, knives in hand and brandishing hatchets.
All unarmed as they were, they were unceremoniously
seized and slain. As no trace was ever found of
their bodies, they were, although denied by the eye-witness of
the tragedy, a squaw, probably devoured on the spot. The
younger men now stole again to the French camp and massacred
all the others in their sleep, save one, who being
wounded feigned death, and afterwards managed to crawl
off. But he, with his companions, had been stripped to
the skin by the savages, and in this state, and half-covered
with blood, he made his way back to the fort. The distance
being ten leagues, his survival is a matter of wonder, even to
those hardy men of the wilderness.</p>

<p>The Governor naturally apprehended that the Indians
would attempt to follow up their crime by an attack upon
the fort.</p>

<p>As only nine men remained in the garrison, it was felt
impossible to defend both of the French establishments. He
therefore withdrew the men hastily from the little Fort Philipeaux
near by, and none too quickly, for the Indians came
immediately before it. Finding nobody in charge they
wrought a speedy and vigorous pillage, taking many pounds
of powder which Jérémie had not had time to transfer to
Bourbon.</p>

<p>The condition of the French during the winter of 1708-9
was pitiable in the extreme. Surrounded by starving, blood-thirsty
savages, with insufficient provisions, and hardly ever
daring to venture out, they may well have received the tidings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
with joy that the indomitable English Company had re-established
a Factory some leagues distant, and were driving a
brisk trade with the eager tribes.</p>

<p>It was not until 1713 that the French Fur Company succeeded
in relieving its post of Fort Bourbon. It had twice
sent ships, but these had been intercepted on the high seas
by the English and pillaged or destroyed. The <i>Providence</i>
arrived the very year of the Treaty of Utrecht.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Starvation
amongst the
Indians.</p>

<p>But wretched as was the case of the French, that of the
Indians was lamentable indeed. A few more years of French
occupation and the forests and rivers of the Bay would know
its race of hunters no more. Many hundreds lay dead within
a radius of twenty leagues from the fort, the
flesh devoured from their bones. They had
lost the use of the bow and arrow since the
advent of the Europeans, and they had no
resource as cultivators of the soil; besides their errant life
forbade this. Pressed by a long hunger, parents had killed
their children for food; the strong had devoured the weak.
One of these unhappy victims of civilization and commercial
rivalries, confessed to the commandant that he had eaten his
wife and six children. He had, he declared, not experienced
the pangs of tenderness until the time came for him to sacrifice
his last child, whom he loved more than the others, and
that he had gone away weeping, leaving a portion of the body
buried in the earth.</p>

important quarter of the Bay known as Port Nelson.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>Although now on the threshold of a long period of adversity,
the Merchants-Adventurers, losing neither hope nor
courage, continued to raise their voice for restitution and
justice. Petition after petition found its way to King, Commons,
and the Lords of Trade and Plantations.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The
Company's
claims.</p>

<p>In May, 1700, the Company were requested by the Lord of
Trade and Plantations to send an account of
the encroachments of the French on Her
Majesty's Dominion in America within the
limits of the Company's charter; to which the
Company replied, setting forth their right and title, and
praying restitution.</p>

<p>It has been stated, and urged as a ground against the later
pretensions of the Hudson's Bay Company, that at this time
they were willing to contract their limits. While willing to do
this for the purpose of effecting a settlement, it was only on
condition of their not being able to obtain "the whole Straits
and Bay which of right belongs to them."</p>

<p>"This," remarked a counsel for the Company in a later day,
"is like a man who has a suit of ejectment, who, in order to
avoid the expense and trouble of a law suit, says, 'I will be
willing to allow you certain bounds, but if you do not accept
that I will insist on getting all my rights and all that I am
entitled to.'"</p>

<p>The Company's propositions soon began to take a definite
form.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">The Company's Claims after the Treaty of Ryswick.</span></p>

<p class="hanging">[<i>To the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of Trade and
Plantations.</i>]</p>

<p>The limits which the Hudson's Bay Company conceive to be necessary
as boundaries between the French and them in case of an exchange
of places, and that the Company cannot obtain the whole Streights and
Bay, which of right belongs to them, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That the French be limited not to trade by wood-runners, or otherwise,
nor build any House, Factory, or Fort, beyond the bounds of 53
degrees, or Albany River, vulgarly called Chechewan, to the northward,
on the west or main coast.</p>

<p>2. That the French be likewise limited not to trade by wood-runners,
or otherwise, nor build any House, Factory, or Fort, beyond Rupert's
River, to the northward, on the east or main coast.</p>

<p>3. On the contrary, the English shall be obliged not to trade by wood-runners,
or otherwise, nor build any House, Factory, or Fort, beyond
the aforesaid latitude of 53 degrees, or Albany River, vulgarly called
Chechewan, south-east towards Canada, on any land which belongs to the
Hudson's Bay Company.</p>

<p>4. As also the English be likewise obliged not to trade by wood-runners,
or otherwise, nor build any House, Factory, or Fort, beyond
Rupert's River, to the south-east, towards Canada, on any land which
belongs to the Hudson's Bay Company.</p>

<p>5. As likewise, that neither the French or English shall at any time
hereafter extend their bounds contrary to the aforesaid limitations, nor
instigate the natives to make war, or join with either, in any acts of
hostility to the disturbance or detriment of the trade of either nation,
which the French may very reasonably comply with, for that they by such
limitations will have all the country south-eastward betwixt Albany Fort
and Canada to themselves, which is not only the best and most fertile
part, but also a much larger tract of land than can be supposed to be to
the northward, and the Company deprived of that which was always their
undoubted right.</p>

<p>And unless the Company can be secured according to these propositions,
they think it will be impossible for them to continue long at York
Fort (should they exchange with the French), nor will the trade answer
their charge; and therefore if your lordships cannot obtain these so
reasonable propositions from the French, but that they insist to have the
limits settled between [Albany and] York and Albany Fort, as in the
latitude of 55 degrees or thereabouts, the Company can by no means
agree thereto, for they by such an agreement will be the instruments of
their own ruin, never to be retrieved.</p>

<p class="left45">
By order of the General Court,</p>

<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Wm. Potter</span>, <i>Secretary</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging">Confirmed by the General Court of<br />
the said Company, 10th July, 1700.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>The adventurers were, they said, not indisposed to listen to
reason. They proposed limits to be observed by the two
nations in their trade and possessions in the Bay. But
should the French be so foolish as to refuse their offer, then
they would not be bound by that or any former concession,
but would then, as they had always theretofore done, "insist
upon the prior and undoubted right to the whole of the
Bay and straits."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Lewis
proposes
boundaries.</p>

<p>The Court of Versailles was now most anxious to delimit
the boundaries of the respective possessions of the two
countries in the Bay. To this end, proposals were exchanged
between the two crown governments. One
alternative proposed by the French Ambassador
was that the Weemish River, which was exactly
half way between Fort Bourbon and Fort
Albany, should mark the respective limits of the French on
the east, while the limits of New France on the side of
Acadia should be restricted to the River St. George.</p>

<p>This proposition having been referred to them, the Board
of Trade and Plantations discouraged the scheme. The
Hudson's Bay Adventurers it said, challenged an undoubted
right to the whole Bay, antecedent to any pretence of the
French. It was, therefore, requisite that they should be consulted
before any concession of territories could be made to
the Most Christian King or his subjects.</p>

<p>The Company pinned their hopes to an outbreak of
hostilities,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> which would enable them to attempt to regain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
what they had lost. A protracted peace was hardly looked
for by the nation. In answer to Governor Knight's continual
complaints, to which were added those of the dispossessed
Geyer, the Company begged its servants to bide their time;
and to exert themselves to the utmost to increase the trade
at Albany, and Moose, and Rupert's River.</p>

<p>"England," says the historian Green, "was still clinging
desperately to the hope of peace, when Lewis, by a sudden
act, forced it into war. He had acknowledged William as
King in the Peace of Ryswick, and pledged himself to oppose
all the attacks on his throne. He now entered the bed-chamber
at St. Germain, where James was breathing his last,
and promised to acknowledge his son at his death as King of
England, Scotland and Ireland."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Outbreak
of the war
between
England and
France.</p>

<p>Such a promise was tantamount to a declaration of war,
and in a moment England sprang to arms. None were
so eager for the approaching strife as the
Honourable Merchants-Adventurers. They expressed
their opinion that, while their interests
had undoubtedly suffered at the peace of 1697,
they were far from attributing it to any want
of care on the part of his Majesty. Their
rights and claims, they said, were then "overweighed by
matters of higher consequence depending in that juncture
for the glory and honour of the King."</p>

<p>Yet a dozen more years were to elapse before they were
to come into their own again; and during that critical period
much was to happen to affect their whole internal economy.
The value of the shares fell; the original Adventurers were
all since deceased, and many of their heirs had disposed of
their interests. A new set of shareholders appeared on the
scene; not simultaneously, but one by one, until almost the
entire personnel of the Company had yielded place to a new,
by no means of the same weight or calibre.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the manner in which
the Company devoted its thought and energy to its weekly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
meetings. Not even in the gravest crises to which the East
India Company was subjected, was there a statute more
inconvenient or severe, than the following: "Resolved and
ordered by the Committee, to prevent the Company's business
from being delayed or neglected, that for the future if any
member do not appear by one hour after the time mentioned
in the summons and the glass run out, or shall depart without
leave of the Committee, such member shall have no part in
the moneys to be divided by the Committee, and that the
time aforesaid be determined by the going of the clock in the
Court-room, which the Secretary is to set as he can to the
Exchange clock; and that no leave shall be given until one
hour after the glass is run out."</p>

<p>But out of their adversity sprung a proposition which,
although not put into effect upon a large scale until many
years afterwards, yet well deserves to be recorded here. To
stem the tide of desertions from the Company's service,
caused by the war, and the low rate of wages, it was in 1710
first suggested that youthful Scotchmen be employed.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">Employment
of Scotchmen
in the service.</p>

<p>The scarcity of servants seems to have continued. In the
following year greater bribes were resorted to. "Captain
Mounslow was now ordered to provide fifteen or sixteen
young able men to go to H. B. This expedition for five
years, which he may promise to have wages,
viz.: £8 the 1st year; £10 the 2nd; £12 the
3rd and £14 for the two last years, and to be
advanced £3 each before they depart from
Gravesend." The result of this was that in June, 1711, the
first batch of these servants came aboard the Company's
ship at Stromness. But they were not destined to sail away
to the Bay in their full numbers. Overhauled by one of
Her Majesty's ships, eleven of the young men were impressed
into the service. For many years after this incident it was
not found easy to engage servants in the Orkneys.</p>

</div>

<p>Captain Barlow was governor at Albany Fort in 1704 when
the French came overland from Canada to besiege it. The
Canadians and their Indian guides lurked in the neighbourhood
of Albany for several days before they made the attack,
and killed many of the cattle that were grazing in the marshes.
A faithful Home Indian (as those Crees in the vicinity were
always termed), who was on a hunting excursion, discovered
those strangers, and correctly supposing them to be enemies,
immediately returned to the fort and informed the governor
of the circumstance. Barlow, while giving little credit to the
report, yet took immediately every measure for the fort's
defence. Orders were given to the master of a sloop hard
by to hasten to the fort should he hear a gun fired.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night the French came before the fort,
marched up to the gate and demanded entrance. Barlow,
who was on watch, told them that the governor was asleep,
but he would go for the keys at once. The French, according
to the governor, on hearing this, and expecting no resistance,
flocked up to the gate as close as they could stand. Barlow
took advantage of this opportunity, and instead of opening
the gate opened two port-holes, and discharged the contents
of two six-pounders into the gathering. This quantity of
grape-shot slaughtered great numbers of the French, and
amongst them their commander, who was an Irishman.</p>

<p>A precipitate retreat followed such an unexpected reception;
and the master of the sloop hearing the firing proceeded
with the greatest haste to the spot. But some of the enemy,
who lay in ambush on the river's bank, intercepted and killed
him, with his entire crew.</p>

<p>Seeing no chance of surprising the fort, the French retired
reluctantly, and did not renew the attack; although some of
them were heard shooting in the neighbourhood for ten days
after their repulse. One man in particular was noticed to
walk up and down the platform leading from the gate of
the fort to the launch for a whole day. At sundown Fullerton,
the governor, thinking his conduct extraordinary, ventured
out and spoke to the man in French. He offered him
lodgings within the fort if he chose to accept them; but to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
such and similar proposals the man made no reply, shaking
his head. Fullerton then informed him that unless he would
surrender himself as his prisoner he would have no alternative
but to shoot him. In response to this the man advanced
nearer the fort. The governor kept his word, and the
unhappy Frenchman fell, pierced by a bullet. No explanation
of his eccentric behaviour was ever forthcoming, but
it may be that the hardships he expected to encounter on
his return to Canada had unbalanced his mind, and made
him prefer death to these while scorning surrender.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Desperate
condition of
the French at
Fort York.</p>

<p>It was some solace to know that their French rivals were in
trouble, and that York Factory had hardly proved as great a
source of profit to the French Company as had been anticipated.
The achievements of Iberville and his brothers had
done little, as has been shown, to permanently better its
fortunes. To such an extent had these declined, that the
capture, in 1704, of the principal ship of the French Company
by an English frigate, forced these traders to
invoke the assistance of the Mother Country in
providing them with facilities for the relief of
the forts and the transportation of the furs to
France. In the following year, the garrison at
Fort Bourbon nearly perished for lack of provisions. The
assistance was given; but two years later it was,
because they could no longer spare either ships or men.
Although both were urgently needed for defence against
the New Englanders. Owing to the enormous increase of
unlicensed bushrangers, the continued hostilities and the
unsettled state of the country, no small proportion of the
entire population chose rather to adventure the perils of
illicit trade in the wilderness, than to serve the king in the
wars at home.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Unaccustomed for so long a period to till
the soil, their submission was not easily secured, no matter
how dire the penalties.</p>

<p>Finding their continual petitions to the Lords of Trade
ineffectual, the Company now drew up a more strongly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
worded one and presented it to Queen Anne herself. The
memorial differed from any other, inasmuch as the Company
now lay stress for the first time on some other feature of
their commerce than furs.</p>

<p>"The said country doth abound with several other commodities
(of which your petitioners have not been able to
begin a trade, by reason of the interruptions they have
met with from the French) as of whale-bone, whale-oil (of
which last your subjects now purchase from Holland and
Germany to the value of £26,000 per annum, which may be
had in your own dominions), besides many other valuable
commodities, which in time may be discovered."</p>

<p>If the French, it was argued, came to be entirely possessed
of Hudson's Bay, they would undoubtedly give up whale
fishing in those parts, which will greatly tend to the increase
of their navigation and to their breed of seamen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
When your Majesty, in your high wisdom, shall think fit to give peace
to those enemies whom your victorious arms have so reduced and
humbled, and when your Majesty shall judge it for your people's good
to enter into a treaty of peace with the French King, your petitioners
pray that the said Prince be obliged by such treaty, to renounce all right
and pretensions to the Bay and Streights of Hudson, to quit and
surrender all posts and settlements erected by the French, or which are
now in their possession, as likewise not to sail any ships or vessels within
the limits of the Company's charter, and to make restitution of the
£108,514, 19s. 8d., of which they robbed and despoiled your petitioners
in times of perfect amity between the two Kingdoms.

<p>This petition seems actually to have come into the hands
of the Queen and to have engaged her sympathy, for which
the Honourable Adventurers had to thank John Robinson,
the Lord Bishop of London. This dignitary, <i>persona grata</i>
in the highest degree to the sovereign, was also a close
personal friend of the Lake family, whose fortunes<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> were long

</p>

<p>At last the Company had triumphed. Its rights had been
admitted; the Queen and her ministers were convinced of the
justice of its claims.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Peace, long and anxiously awaited,
began to dawn over the troubled horizon. Lewis and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
courtiers had long sickened of the war: and at the Flemish
town of Utrecht negotiations were on foot for a cessation of
hostilities and the adjustment of differences between the
crowns of England and France.</p>

<p>The view which Matthew Prior, the English plenipotentiary,
took of the Company's rights was not one, however, inspired
by that body. He wanted the trade of the country, rather
than the sovereignty.</p>

<p>"I take leave to add to your lordship," he observes at the
end of a communication addressed to the Secretary of State,
"that these limitations are not otherwise advantageous or
prejudicial to Great Britain than as we are both better or
worse with the native Indians; and that the whole is a matter
rather of industry than of dominion."</p>

<p>These negotiations finally resulted in a treaty signed on the
31st of March (O.S.), 1713, by which the whole of Hudson's
Bay was ceded to Great Britain without any distinct definition
of boundaries, for the determining of which commissioners
were to be appointed.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Effect of the
Treaty on the
Company.</p>

<p>On the news of the conclusion of the Treaty, the Adventurers
were filled with joy. The Committee was in session
when a messenger came hot haste from Whitehall
to bear the glad tidings. A General Court
was convoked for several days later. Plans
were concerted for securing the very most
that the circumstances would allow. It was necessary to
secure the Act of Cession which it was supposed would be
issued by Lewis, ceding to Great Britain the places on Hudson's
Bay, the Company being regarded merely in the light
of sub-ordinary subjects. Many of the members wished to
press at once for pecuniary compensation, but the wiser
heads agreed that this would best be a matter for subsequent
negotiation. Many thought indeed that perhaps there need
be no haste in the matter, as the interest on the original
estimate of damages, already nearly double the principal,
was growing daily at an enormous rate.</p>

<p>"As to the Company's losses," says a memorandum of this
year, "it will appear by a true and exact estimate that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
French took from the Company in full peace between 1682
and 1688 seven ships, with their cargoes, and six forts and
caches in which were carried away great stores of goods laid
up for trading with the Indians. The whole amounts to
£38,332 15s., and £62,210 18s. 9d. interest, computed to
1713."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Company's
claim for
compensation.</p>

<p>Under date of 30th July, 1714, occurs the following: "The
Committee having received a letter from the Lords Commissioners
of Trade, and they desiring their attendance on
Tuesday next, and to bring in writing the
demands of the Co. for damages rec'd from
the French in times of peace pursuant to the
10th &amp; 11th Articles of the Treaty of Utrecht.
Upon which the Secretary is ordered to Copy out the
Abstract of the whole damage sustained, amounting to with
Interest the sum of £100,543-13-9; as likewise the particulars
in these small volumes in order to present the same to
the Commission of Trade on Wednesday next."</p>

<p>It does not seem to have been doubted but that the Queen,
if petitioned, would grant the Company's request in time to
send an expedition to the Bay that very year.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>But while vessels were being acquired, fitted out and loaded
with cargoes, the Company was wise enough not to run the
risk of falling into a trap. Nothing was to be done without
the fullest royal authority.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark as illustrating how much the Company
trusted the Canadian authorities, Bolingbroke (May 29,
1713) reminded the Duke of Shrewsbury (then at Paris) that
in Pontchartrain's letter to the Marquis de Vaudreuil, Governor
of Canada, the latter was directed to yield the forts and
settlements belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company: "But
this order the Merchants thought would hardly fulfil their
requirements. They were despatching two ships to the Bay.
It would therefore be better if his grace obtained direct order
to M. Jérémie in duplicate."</p>

<p class="sidenote">No Act of
Cession.</p>

<p>But the Act of Cession eagerly awaited by the Company
was not forthcoming. The Queen's advisers were wiser than
anybody else. Lord Dartmouth's letter<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> of the 27th May, 1713,
enclosing the petition of the Hudson's Bay
Company, shows what was the design in not
accepting an Act of Cession from the French
King. Her Majesty insisted only upon an order from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
French Court for delivering possession; "by which means
the title of the Company was acknowledged, and they will
come into the immediate enjoyment of their property without
further trouble."</p>

<p>The summer of 1713 came on apace, and it was soon too
late to think of occupying Port Nelson that year. But all
was made ready for the next. On the 5th of June, 1714,
many of the Adventurers hied themselves to Gravesend, to
wish Governor Knight and his deputy, Henry Kelsey, godspeed.
"The Committee," we read in the minutes, "delivered
to Captain Knight, Her Majesty's Royal Commission, to take
possession (for the Company) of York Fort, and all other
places within the Bay and Straits of Hudson. Also another
Commission from Her Majesty constituting him Governor
under the Company, and Mr. H. Kelsey, Deputy Governor of
the Bay and Straits of Hudson, aforesaid."</p>

<p>Knight took with him, likewise, "the French King's order
under his hand and seal, to Mons. Jérémie, Commander at
York Fort, to deliver the same to whom Her Majesty should
appoint, pursuant to the Treaty of Utrick."</p>

<p>Knight's eyes, now dimmed with age, were gladdened by
the sight of Port Nelson, on the 25th of July. Jérémie was
already advised by the French ship, and no time was lost in
evacuation. A bargain was made for such buildings and
effects as the French had no further use for, which had
been beforehand arranged. "From his particular regard
for the Queen of Great Britain, the King will leave to
her the artillery and ammunition in the forts and places
in Hudson's Bay and Straits, notwithstanding the urgent
reasons His Majesty has to withdraw them, and to appropriate
them elsewhere." The cannon were accordingly
left.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Regulation of
boundary.</p>

<p>By Article X of the Treaty of Utrecht it was proposed, in
order to avoid all further conflict and misunderstanding,
that commissioners should be appointed
to regulate the boundaries of Hudson's Bay and
the extent of the trade thereof, which should be enjoyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
by each.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> But no great haste was apparent on the part of
France to secure this end. For several years nothing was
done in the matter, save and except the persistent exchange
of letters between the two ambassadors. There is a letter
of Bolingbroke's which evinces the feeling current in diplomatic
circles at the time.</p>

<p>"There is nothing more persistent in the world," he says,
"than these claims of the Hudson's Bay Company. We are
desirous greatly to see all these smug ancient gentlemen
satisfied; but notwithstanding we are unable to budge an
inch. The truth of the business seems to me to be that the
French are always hoping that their ultimate concessions will
be less and the English that these concessions will be vastly
more. As for ourselves we have no desire to play with frost;
and I for one shall be relieved to see this question thawed out
without further delay."</p>

<p>Lewis had consented, at the time of the Peace, to afterwards
name two commissioners who should give possession to such
of the English, as proved that they were actual proprietors, or
the heirs of proprietors of those who had in a former time
possessed property in the Bay. This seemed to provide for
the Company's rights in a manner most satisfactory.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Appointment
of a Commission.</p>

<p>Nevertheless matters dragged on, and it was not until 1719
that a practical movement was made. On the 3rd of September
of that year, Daniel Pulteney and Martin
Bladen, Lords of Trade, were appointed Commissioners
in response to the appointment by
Lewis of the Mareschal Comte d'Estrees and
the Abbé Dubois, Minister and Secretary of State. Pulteney
was an Indian merchant, and Bladen had been an officer in
the army.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>The Lords of Trade having made the suggestion, the
Company now wished their Governor, Sir Bibye Lake, to go
over to Paris the "more earnestly to solicit and prosecute the
claims of the Honourable Adventurers."</p>

<p>"It is by this Committee desired most humbly of the
Governor to accept and undertake this journey and to manage
the Company's affairs there, as he shall judge most
conducive to their interest and advantage. Which, being
signified to the Governor, he did, to the great satisfaction
of the Committee readily undertake and accept the same.
It was ordered that the Governor have liberty to take
with him such person or persons to France as he shall
think fit."</p>

<p>Lake accordingly joined Bladen and Pulteney, and was
permitted to take a silent part in the conference.</p>

<p>It was intended that this Commission, meeting in Paris,
should have power to settle generally the boundaries between
the English and French possessions in America. But this
was soon seen to be impracticable. The settlement of these
matters was too vast and complicated for the Commission
to deal with; and the Lords of Trade instructed Bladen, on
his setting out, to deal only with the Hudson's Bay territories.
It is significant that private instructions of a similar nature
were at the same time conveyed to the French Commissioners
by the Court.</p>

<p>The Commissioners finally met. Perhaps it would be a
pity if Bladen's own quaint account of what followed were
allowed to perish:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
On Saturday last, my Lord Stair and I met Marechal d'Estrees and
Abbé Dubois. Our time was spent in preparatory discourses concerning
the intent of the 10th article of the Treaty of Utrecht, relating to the
boundaries of Hudson's Bay; and at our next meeting, which will be
to-morrow at my Lord Stair's House, we design to give in the claim of the
Hudson's Bay Company, in writing, with some few additions pretty
material for their service, in case the Abbé Dubois his health will allow
him to be there, which I fear it will not, for he is confined at present to
his bed.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Martin
Bladen's
description
of the
Commission.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
But I confess, I cannot help thinking it will be to a very little purpose
to puzzle ourselves about setting boundaries, by treaty,
in the North of America, if the French have so concise
a way of fixing theirs in the south, without asking our
concurrence; it is to be hoped they will have the
modesty to recede from this new acquisition, but in the
meantime I cannot help saying this gives me no very
good relish either of their friendship or discretion.</p>

<p>I cannot leave this subject without observing how much it imports us
to be upon our guard in our American Colonies. It were to be wished
that the several Governments of His Majesty's plantations would pay the
respect they owe to their instructions, and if those of Barbados for some
time past had observed theirs, relating to Santa Lucia, the settlement of
a hundred French families there could never have been put upon us at
this day as a proof of their right to that island.
</p>
</div>

<p>There is, further, much talk of a "multiplicity of books and
papers necessary to be read," and of "arduous labours" in
going over maps, charts and memoirs, which, however numerous,
"are not to be depended on."<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>While this initial work was going on, one of the adventurers
was entreating his fellows at a Company meeting in
London, to take note of a scheme which the French had
been insidiously attempting for the previous four years to
utterly destroy not only the Company's trade, but all the
English colonies as well. He proceeded to read a private
letter from a relation in the colony of Pennsylvania in which
it was shewn that the Mississippi Company required close
watching.</p>

<p>"Its leaders are egged on by the Jesuits, and will stop at no
bloody measures to draw down trade from the Indians.
Their projects must inevitably succeed if we are not watchful."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<p>This was put forward as one potent reason why the French
were complaisant about yielding us the Bay itself. It was but
the shell they would surrender, whilst preserving to themselves
the kernel.</p>

<p>This letter from the Pennsylvanian had its effect upon the
easily-alarmed adventurers, for they lost no time in communicating
their apprehensions to the Lords of Trade.</p>

<p>The matter was sent forward to Bladen and Pulteney. "It
were heartily to be wished," the Company observed, "that in
imitation of our industrious neighbours the French, some
means can be determined upon to extend the trade in furs
southwards."</p>

<p>In response, Bladen imparted a brilliant idea. He suggested
that St. Augustine might be "reduced at a small cost," and
advantage taken thereby of the war then in progress with
Spain.</p>

<p>Matters went on in Paris as badly as could be. The English
commissioners lost all patience. Nothing was in the air but
John Law and his Mississippi scheme. The three distinguished
Englishmen, Bladen, Pulteney and Lake, were dined
and feted: but were at length disgusted with the whole
business.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The "smug ancient gentlemen," as Bolingbroke had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
irreverently dubbed the Honourable Adventurers, were not
to be satisfied in regard to the delimitation of boundaries and
at this time. But perhaps even they had less interest in
Hudson's Bay at heart than new interests which had dramatically
arisen much nearer home.</p>

<p>Governor Lake was sent for suddenly from London, and
Bladen and Pulteney were not long in following him.

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<br />
1719-1727.</h2>

<p class="hanging">
The South Sea Bubble&mdash;Nation Catches the Fever of Speculation&mdash;Strong
Temptation for the Company&mdash;Pricking of the Bubble&mdash;Narrow
Escape of the Adventurers&mdash;Knight and his Expedition&mdash;Anxiety
as to their Fate&mdash;Certainty of their Loss&mdash;Burnet's Scheme
to Cripple the French&mdash;It Forces them Westward into Rupert's
Land.
</p>

<p>The cause of the Governor's recall lay in the existence of
a crisis which promised a happy issue. It arose through the
venality of some of the Company's directors, who were victims
of the South Sea fever.</p>

<p class="sidenote">South Sea
Company.</p>

<p>The South Sea Company, whose extraordinary success gave
rise to a thousand joint stock enterprises equally
unsound and fatuous, owed its origin to Harley,
Earl of Oxford, in 1711, who in return for the
acceptance of a government debt of £10,000,000 granted
to a number of merchants a monopoly of the trade to the
South Seas.</p>

<p>At that time the most extravagant ideas prevailed concerning
the riches of South America. "If," it was said, "the
Hudson's Bay Company can make vast moneys out of the
frozen North, what can be done with lands flowing with milk
and honey?" The South Sea Adventurers carefully fostered
all the current notions, spreading likewise the belief that
Spain was ready to admit them to a share of its South
American commerce.</p>

<p>In 1717 this Company advanced to the English Government
five more millions sterling, at an interest of six per cent.
Their shares rose daily. Even the outbreak of war with
Spain, which destroyed all hope in the minds of sensible
persons of any share in the Spanish traffic, did not lessen the
Company's popularity. In Paris, John Law's Mississippi
Bubble burst, ruining thousands, but, far from being alarmed
at this catastrophe, it was universally believed that Law's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
scheme was sound, but had been wrecked through unwise
methods. In May, 1720, the South Sea Company proposed
to take upon themselves the entire national debt of upwards
of £30,000,000 upon a guarantee of five per cent. per annum
for seven and one-half years, at the end of which period the
debt might be redeemed if the Government chose, or the
interest reduced to four per cent. The nation was dazzled;
Parliament accepted the offer; and the Company's stock rose
steadily to 330 on April 7, falling to 290 on the following day.</p>

<p class="sidenote">A fever of
speculation.</p>

<p>This day in April witnessed a change in methods on the
part of the South Sea directors. Until then the scheme
had been honestly promoted; but the prospect of enormous
wealth was too near to be permitted to escape.
It became thenceforward, until the crash, the
prime object of the directors, at no matter what
cost or scruple, to maintain the fictitious value of the shares.
By May 28, £100 shares were quoted at 550; three days
later they had reached 890. The whole nation caught the
fever; the steadiest merchants turned gamblers. Hardly a
day passed without a new swindling concern being started
as a joint stock company.</p>

<p>Meanwhile several of the Hudson's Bay Merchants-Adventurers
looked on with envious eyes. The desire was great to
embark in so tempting a scheme, and the opportunity to cast
inflated shares on the market almost too great to withstand.</p>

<p>But for many weeks the temptation was resisted. At
last, at a meeting early in August, the chief director came
before a general court of the Adventurers with a scheme
by which each partner could either retire with a moderate
fortune or remain an active participant, and reap the benefit
of an infusion of public capital.</p>

<p>The scheme was simplicity itself, to modern notions; but
that it was not so regarded by some of the Adventurers
themselves may be gathered from the following passage from
a letter of Mrs. Mary Butterfield, one of the owners of the
Company's stock.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you how it is to be done, for that passes my
wit; but in short, the value of our interests is to be trebled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
without our paying a farthing; and then to be trebled again
if the business is to the publick taste, and we are told it
cannot fail to be."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Plan to
reorganize
the Company.</p>

<p>It was late in August before the scheme was detailed. It
was explained that the Company's assets in quick and dead
stock and lands were £94,500. With this as a basis, it
was proposed to enlarge the stock to the sum of £378,000,
dividing this into 3,780 shares of £100 each. Before this
could be carried out, however, the existing stock, being but
£31,500, or 315 shares, was to be made and reckoned 945
shares of £100 value each. By such means a result of £94,500
actual capital would appear. A majority of partners
favoured the scheme, and the proposal was carried amidst the
greatest enthusiasm. Its purpose was to unload the stock
at an inflated figure, far even in excess of that actually
named by its promoters. Had it succeeded and the flotation
been carried out, it would have doubtless administered
a death-blow to the Company as then
organized, and would probably have involved the
revocation of its charter in view of what was
soon to occur. But the plan met with a sudden arrest by
an event which then happened, and which in beggaring
multitudes altered the whole disposition of the public with
regard to joint stock enterprises.</p>

<p>A general impression had gained ground that the South
Sea Company's stock had attained high-water mark, and so
many holders rushed to realize that the price fell, on June
3rd, to 640. The directors were not yet ready for their
<i>coup</i>. Agents were despatched by them to buy up and
support the market, and the result was that by nightfall of
that day the quoted price was £750. By means of this and
similarly unscrupulous devices, the shares were sent, early
in August, to 1,000. This was the long-awaited opportunity.
Many of the directors sold out; a general anxiety began
to prevail and the shares began to drop. In view of this
change in affairs, the Hudson's Bay Company's meeting for
September 3rd was deferred. On the 12th, South Sea shares
were selling at 400, and the decline continued. The country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
was thrown into the greatest excitement, and by the time
December had arrived, Parliament had been hastily summoned
to consider the calamity.</p>

<p>With what happened subsequently, to the authors and
participators in this celebrated joint stock swindle, it is not
my present purpose to deal, except to say that the Hudson's
Bay Company was saved in the nick of time from sharing
the fate of its neighbour and rival. A meeting on the 23rd of
December was held, at which it was resolved that the "said
subscription be vacated; and that the Company's seal be
taken off from the said instrument."</p>

<p>Nevertheless one permanent result remained. The capital
had been trebled, and it was now further resolved that each
subscriber should have £30 of stock "for each £10 by
him paid in." This trebled, the total capital stood, at the
beginning of 1721, at £94,500.</p>

<p>The Company had had a narrow escape. To what extent
its shares would have been inflated may be conjectured; but
it is certain that it could not have avoided being swept into
the vortex and sharing the same fate which overtook so many
of its commercial contemporaries. Its enemies were on the
watch, and they would have proved relentless. The revocation
of its charter would have accomplished its final downfall.
Already the Company was being assailed because it had not
complied with one of the provisions named in that instrument:
that of making search for a north-west passage.</p>

<p>It was not, however, to quiet these reproaches, so persistently
levelled at it, that a year before the bursting of the
South Sea Bubble an expedition was actually set on foot to
accomplish the long-deferred exploration.</p>

<p>Knight, the Company's aged Governor at York Factory,
had long listened to the tales of the Indians concerning the
copper mines to the north; and resolved, on his return to
England, to bring the matter before the Company. This he
did, but it was by no means an easy matter to induce the
Adventurers to consent to the expense of further exploration.
Nevertheless Knight's insistence prevailed, more especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
as, besides the profitable results to be obtained through such
a voyage, he was careful to point out that the Company were
expected by their charter to undertake such an expedition.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Expedition to
explore the
north-west
passage.</p>

<p>In 1719 the Company, therefore, fitted out two ships for
the purpose of discovery north of Churchill. One of these,
called the <i>Albany</i>, a frigate, was commanded by George
Barlow, whom we have already seen as Deputy-Governor
at Albany in 1704, when the French
failed to capture that post. The other, named
the <i>Discovery</i>, a sloop, under David Vaughan.
But the command of the expedition itself was entrusted to
Knight, who was a man of great experience in the Company's
service, who had been for many years Governor of different
Factories in the Bay, and who had made the first settlement
at Churchill River.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of the experience Knight possessed
of the Company's business, and its methods of trade with the
Indians, there was nothing to lead any one to suppose him
especially adapted for the present enterprise, having nothing
to direct him but the slender and imperfect accounts which
he, in common with many other of the Company's servants
had received from the Indians, who, as we have seen, were
at that time little known and less understood.</p>

<p>But these disadvantages, added to his advanced years, he
being then nearly eighty, by no means deterred his bold
spirit. Indeed, so confident was he of success and of the
material advantages which would accrue from his impending
discoveries, that he caused to be made, and carried with him,
several large iron-bound chests, wherein to bestow the gold
dust and other treasures which he "fondly flattered himself
were to be found in those parts."</p>

<p>The first paragraph of the Company's instructions to
Knight on this occasion was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65">4th June, 1719.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">To Captain James Knight.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;From the experience we have had of your abilities in the management
of our affairs, we have, upon your application to us, fitted out the
<i>Albany</i> frigate, Captain George Barlow, and the <i>Discovery</i>, Captain
David Vaughan, Commander, upon a discovery to the northward; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
to that end have given you power and authority to act and do all things
relating to the said voyage, navigation of the said ship and sloop only
excepted; and have given orders and instructions to our said Commanders
for that purpose. You are, with the first opportunity of wind
and weather, to depart from Gravesend on your intended voyage, and by
God's permission to find out the Straits of Anian, and to discover gold
and other valuable commodities to the northward.</p>
</div>

<p>Knight departed from Gravesend on board the <i>Albany</i>,
and proceeded on his voyage. The ships not returning to
England that year no uneasiness was felt, as it was judged
they had wintered in the Bay. Besides, both were known to
have on board a plentiful stock of provisions, a house in
frame, together with the requisite tools and implements, and
a large assortment of trading goods. Little anxiety was
therefore entertained concerning their safety for fifteen
months. But when New Year's Day, 1721, arrived, and
neither ship nor sloop had been heard from, the Company
became alarmed for their welfare.</p>

<p>By the ship sailing to Churchill in June they sent orders for
a sloop then in the Bay, called the <i>Whalebone</i>, John Scroggs,
master, to go in search of the missing explorers. But the
<i>Whalebone</i> was cruising about in the north of the Bay at the
time, on the Esquimaux trade, and returned to Churchill at
so advanced a season of the year as to defer the execution
of the Company's wishes until the following summer.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Anxiety as to
the fate of
the expedition.</p>

<p>The north-west coast was little known in those days, so it
is not singular that Scroggs, on board the little <i>Whalebone</i>,
finding himself encompassed by dangerous shoals and rocks,
should return to Prince of Wales' Fort little the wiser
regarding the fate of the two ships. He saw
amongst the Esquimaux, it is true, European
clothing and articles, as in a later day Rae and
McClintock found souvenirs of the Franklin
tragedy; but these might have been come by in trade, or
even as the result of an accident. None could affirm that
a shipwreck or other total calamity had overtaken Knight
and his companions.</p>

<p>Many years elapsed without anything to shed light on the
fate of this expedition. At first, the strong belief which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
so long prevailed in Europe of a north-west passage by way
of this Bay, caused many to conjecture that the explorers
had found that passage and had gone through it into the
South Sea. But before the voyages of Middleton, Ellis,
Bean, Christopher and Jobington had weakened this belief
it was known that Knight, Barlow and the crews of the
two ships had been lost. Proofs of their fate were found in
the year 1767, as will appear in a later chapter of this work.</p>

<p>An important circumstance now transpired which was not
without effect upon the Company's trade; and which, for a
time, gave the Adventurers great uneasiness.</p>

<p>In 1727 Burnett had been appointed to the Governorship of
New York. Finding that the French in Canada were in
possession of all the Indian fur-trade of the north and west,
which was not in the Hudson's Bay Company's hands, and
that the New Englanders and Iroquois were trafficking with
the Iroquois, he determined to take a bold step with a view
to crippling the French.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Attempt of
New England
to secure the
fur-trade.</p>

<p>It had long been understood that the chief support of New
France was in the fur commerce; and upon enquiry it was
found that the traders, of Quebec and Montreal, were chiefly
supplied with European merchandise for barter from the
New York merchants, from whom they procured it upon
much easier terms than it could possibly be got
from France. With this knowledge, the Governor
resolved to foster the fur-trade of his colony
by inducing direct transactions with the Indians.
He procured an Act in the Assembly of the
colony, prohibiting the trade in merchandise from New York.
The colonial merchants were, not unnaturally, up in arms
against such a measure; but Burnett, bent upon carrying his
point, had their appeal to King George set aside and the Act
confirmed by that monarch.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Contemporary French Map of the Bay and Vicinity.</span></p>
</div>

<p>By this measure, trade at once sprang up with the Western
Indians, since the French had no goods to offer them in any
way to their liking at a reasonable price. Intercourse and
familiarity ensued moreover in consequence; a fortified trading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
post was built at Oswego, which not only drew away
trade from the French, at Michilimackinac and St. Marie,
but from Albany and Moose as well.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Boundaries
between
French and
English
territory.</p>

<p>It has been observed that the ancient boundaries of Canada
or New France were circumscribed by the Treaty of Utrecht,
and that it is difficult to determine precisely the new boundaries
assigned to it. The general interpretation adopted by
the British geographers, as the country gradually became
better known from that time up to the final cession of
Canada, was that the boundary ran along the high lands
separating the waters that discharged into the St. Lawrence
from those that discharge into Hudson's Bay to the sources of
the Nepigon River, and thence along the northerly division of
the same range of high lands dividing the waters flowing
direct to Hudson's Bay, from those flowing into Lake Winnipeg,
and crossing the Nelson, or (as it was then known) the
Bourbon River, about midway between the said
Lake and Bay, thence passing to the west and
north by the sources of Churchill River; no
westerly boundary being anywhere assigned to
Canada. This and other measures could have
but one result: to make the French traders and the Government
of New France perceive that their only hope to avert
famine and bankruptcy lay in penetrating farther and farther
into the west, in an effort to reach remote tribes, ignorant of
true values and unspoilt by a fierce and ungenerous rivalry.</p>

<p>It seems fitting to reserve the next chapter for a consideration
of who and what the tribes were at this time inhabiting
the territories granted by its charter to the Great Company;
together with their numbers, their modes of life and relations
with the factories.

Hudson's Bay Tribes Peaceful&mdash;Effect of the Traders' Presence&mdash;Depletion
of Population&mdash;The Crees and Assiniboines&mdash;Their
Habits and Customs&mdash;Their Numbers&mdash;No Subordination Amongst
Them&mdash;Spirituous Liquors&mdash;Effect of Intemperance upon the Indian.
</p>

<p>Let us imagine for a moment that the Hudson's Bay Company
had held traffic with the fierce and implacable Iroquois,
the Mohawks or the courageous and blood-thirsty tribes of
the Mississippi, instead of with the Crees and Assiniboines.
How different would have been its early history! What
frail protection would have been afforded by the forts and
wooden palisades, often not stronger than that last fort of
the Jesuits in the Huron country, the inmates of which were
slaughtered so ruthlessly, or that other at Niagara, where
the Chevalier de Troyes and ninety of his companions
perished to a man.</p>

<p>But the Red men of the Company's territories, compared to
these, were pacific. Occasionally want or deep injustice drove
them to acts of barbarism, as we have seen in the case of the
massacre at York Factory under Jérémie's <i>régime</i>; but on the
whole they had no marked enmity to the white men, and long
displayed a remarkable and extremely welcome docility.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Character
of the
Assiniboines.</p>

<p>"The Assinibouels," remarked Jérémie, "are humane and
affable; and so are also all those Indians with whom we have
commerce in the Bay, never trading with the French but as
their fathers and patrons. Although savages,
they are foes to lying, which is extraordinary
in nations which live without subordination or
discipline. One cannot impute to them any
vice, unless they are a little too slanderous. They never
blaspheme and have not even a term in their language which
defines an oath."</p>

<p>If we are to believe the early traders and explorers, the
Red man of Rupert's Land spoke a tongue by no means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
difficult for an Englishman to master. Yet if these same
traders really took the trouble to master it, as they alleged,
their knowledge certainly brought little order into the chaos of
tribal nomenclature.</p>

</div>

<p>The custom of fantastic names for the Indians was long
continued. More than one instance occur of the impropriety
with which the French-Canadians named the Indians. They
called one tribe Gros Ventres, or Big Bellies, and that without
any known reason; they being as comely and well-made
as any other tribe. "They are very far," says one trader,
"from being remarkable for their corpulency." This tribe also
came to be known as the Fall Indians.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Indian
country.</p>

<p>Jérémie observed that the Ouinebigonnolinis inhabited the
sea-coast. The Poaourinagou country was
inhabited by the Miskogonhirines or Savannah,
who made war with the Hakouchirmions.
Twelve leagues above York Factory was situated the
River Oujuragatchousibi, while far beyond dwelt the
Nakonkirhirinons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<p>One might readily suspect one commandant of drawing
upon his imagination when he speaks of such nations as the
Unighkillyiakow, Ishisageck
Roanu, the Twightwis Roanu,
the Oskiakikis, Oyachtownuck
Roanu, Kighetawkigh
Roanu, and the Kirhawguagh
Roanu.</p>

</div>

<p>In the seventeenth century,
the districts about the Great
Lakes were rather thickly
populated. Certain regions
which at the opening of the
eighteenth century were but
thinly sprinkled by inhabitants,
once had boasted numerous
tribes. For when the
first missionaries visited the
south of Lake Superior in
1668, they found the country
full of inhabitants. They relate
that, about this time, a
band of Nepisingues, converts
to the Jesuitical teaching,
emigrated to the Nepigon
country. By 1785 few of their
descendants were said to exist, and not a trace amongst
them of the religion espoused by their ancestors.</p>

<p>As to the Lake of the Woods district, before the smallpox,
in 1781, ravaged this country and completed what the
Nodwayes by their warfare had gone far to accomplish, this
part of the country was very densely inhabited.</p>

<p>One of the Company's factors reported, in 1736, that a
tribe lived beyond the range of mountains, who had never
known the use of fire-arms, for which reason they were
made slaves of by the Assiniboines and Crees. He declared
he had beheld several of this tribe "who all wanted a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
joynt of their little finger, which was cut off soon after
birth."</p>

<p>"The Migichihilinons, that
is the Eagle Ey'd Indians,"
reported Middleton, one of
the Company's captains, "are
at two hundred Leagues Distance;
the Assinibouels inhabit
the West and North;
they are reputed to be the
same Nation because of the
great affinity of their language.
The name signifies
Men of the Rock. They
use the Calumet and live at
two hundred and fifty Leagues
Distance. They paint their
Bodies, are grave and have
much Phlegm, like <i>Flemings</i>."
He also enumerates the Michinipic
Poets, or Men of Stone,
of the Great Lake; but I am
inclined to think these two
are of the same tribe.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Indian with Tomahawk.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">The
Crees.</p>

<p>The Crees, or Christineaux,
were the earliest as well as the
most numerous tribe which had dealings with the Company.
They sprang from the same stock as the Ojibways,
Chippewas or Saulteurs, who with the
Assiniboines inhabited the vast interior of the
country to the west of the Bay. Their language, according
to one of the early traders, was less copious and
expressive than their mother tongue. They were deficient
in many direct terms for things, often expressing themselves
in approximate phrases, whereas the Ojibways
would have an exactly corresponding term ready at command.
The Crees appear not to have possessed the custom
of totems, so that it was often difficult for members of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
tribe to trace their ancestry back for more than two or three
generations.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Their mode
of living.</p>

<p>In their ideas of creation the Crees and the Saulteurs
resembled, and the early traders and bushrangers learnt
gradually that both nations owned a mythology of no mean
proportions. Nain au Bouchaw, the God of the Saulteurs,
was known as "Wee-sue-ha-jouch," amongst the Crees; but
the tales they told concerning him were by no means clear
and distinct, nor in such general currency. The Crees were
divided into two groups: those inhabiting the plains, and the
denizens of the woods; the latter being far the most enterprising
and useful to the trade of the Company. The tents
of the Crees, like those of the other tribes in Rupert's Land,
were of dressed leather, erected by means of
poles, seventeen of which latter were required
for the purpose, two being tied together about
three feet from the top. The whole formed nearly a circle
which was then covered with buffalo, moose, or red deer
skins, well sewn together, nicely cut to fit the conical figure
of the poles. An opening was then arranged above to let
out the smoke, and admit the light. Such tents were of
good size, commonly measuring twenty feet in diameter.
A fire was kindled in the centre, around which a range of
stones was placed to keep the fire compact. The Crees were
fond of self-adornment, and were much addicted to false hair.
Their morals at first greatly shocked the servants of the
Company, and in the early reports sent home from York
Factory much stress was laid upon the need for enlightenment
in this regard amongst the savages. Polygamy was
common, but not universal. The first wife was considered as
mistress of the tent, ruling all the others, often with a rod of
iron, and obliging them to perform all the drudgery.</p>

<p>The names of the children were always given to them by
their parents, or some near relative. Those of the boys were
various, and generally derived from some place, season or
animal. The names of the female children, amongst the
northern Indians, were chiefly taken from some part or property
of a marten, such as the White Marten, the Black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
Marten, the Summer Marten, the Marten's Head, the Marten's
Foot, the Marten's Heart, the Marten's Tail, etc.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The exact number of Crees at the time of the Company's
advent, is difficult to compute. Even at that time they were
dispersed over a vast extent of country, mixing with the
Assiniboines and other nations with whom they were on
terms of peace. In 1709 appeared an estimate that there
were not less than a million members of the Cree Nation.
From what source was derived this striking conclusion is
not given.</p>

<p>It may be laid down as a general rule that all contemporary
estimates as to the population of the Indian tribes which
were necessarily founded upon hearsay prior to actual penetration
into their country are fanciful and totally unreliable.
Perhaps the most significant fact which Parkman brought
home to the masses of his readers, was the astounding
discrepancy between current conception of the numbers of
the various tribes, particularly the Iroquois, and that
attested and corroborated by the acute research of scholars,
and by the testimony of contemporaries. In 1749 the
Company thought the number of the Crees to be about
100,000, men, women and children. A half century later
they had diminished to about 14,000, although, in 1810, Henry
can find only about 300 tents full of Crees capable of furnishing
less than 1,000 men. In this calculation, however,
he did not include the Crees who lived north of Beaver River.
The Crees were, for the most part, quiet and inoffensive,
and their personal appearance not entirely prepossessing;
and although compared with the wilder and more valiant
tribes to the south and east, their carriage and deportment
was inferior, still they were gifted with activity, and
prominent, wiry figures and intelligent countenances.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The
Assiniboines.</p>

<p>The next numerous tribe was the Assiniboine, or Stone
Indians, who it is believed originated with the
Sioux or Nodwayes. But owing to some misunderstanding
between the bands they separated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
and some half century before the first fort was built by the
Company they were in possession of a vast extent of prairie
country near the Red River, and thence running westward.
The region they inhabited may be said to commence at the
Hare Hills, near Red River, and running along the Assiniboine
to the junction of the north and south branches of the
Saskatchewan. They were generally of a moderate stature,
slender and active. In complexion they were of a lighter
copper colour than the Crees, with more regular features.
Moreover they were readily distinguished from the latter by
a different head-dress.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0239" id="im_0239"></a>
<img src="images/im_0239.jpg" width="269" height="346" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Esquimau with Dogs.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Other tribes trading with the Company were the Sioux,
Blackfeet, Blood, Slave and Crow Indians. There were also
the Esquimaux, with whom a traffic in the north was carried
on chiefly for whalebone, ivory and oil.</p>

<p>"I have often," wrote Captain Coats, "thought this people
of the lineage of the Chinese, in the many features I see in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
them, their bloated flatt faces, little eyes, black hair, little
hands and feet, and their listlessness in travelling. They are
very fair, when free from grease, very submissive to their men,
very tender to their children, and indefatigable in the geegaws
to please their men and children."</p>

<p>They owned no manner of government or subordination.
The father or head of the family obeyed no superior nor any
command, and he himself only gave his advice or opinions.
Consequently it was rarely that any great chief ever existed,
and then only in time of war. It is true that when several
families went to war, or to the factories to trade, they chose
a leader, but to such a one obedience was only voluntary;
everyone was at liberty to leave when he pleased, and the
notion of a commander was soon obliterated.</p>

<p>Merit alone gave title to distinction; such merit as an
experienced hunter could boast, or one who possessed knowledge
of communication between lakes and rivers, who could
make long harangues, was a conjurer, or had a large family.
Such a man was sure to be followed by several Indians
when they happened to be out in large parties. They likewise
followed him down to trade at the settlements, although
upon such occasions he was forced to secure their attendance
by promises and rewards, as the regard paid to his ability
was of too weak a nature to command subjection. In war
a mutual resentment forced their union for perpetrating
vengeance.</p>

<p>The Hudson's Bay Indian's method of dividing time was by
numbering the nights elapsed or to come. Thus, if he were
asked how long he had been on his journey, he would answer,
"so many nights." From the nocturnal division he proceeded
to lunar or monthly reckoning, twelve to a year, all of
these moons being symbolical of some remarkable event or
appearance.</p>

<p>Their method of computing numbers was abstruse, they
reckoning chiefly by decades: two-tens, three-tens, ten-tens.
A few units over or under were added or subtracted, thirty-two
being three-tens and two over. If they reckoned any large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
number a skin or stick was laid down for every ten, and
afterwards tied in a bundle for the aggregate.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Intelligence
of the
Indians.</p>

<p>The servants of the Company were not a little astonished
at the wonderful intuition of the Indian, which enabled him to
forego the advantage to be derived from a compass,
and yet to rarely miss his way. The trees,
he knew, were all bent to the south, and the
branches on that side were larger and stronger than on the
north, as was also the moss. To apprise his women of the
spot where the game was killed, he broke off branches here
and there, laying them in the path with their ends pointed
in the requisite direction.</p>

<p>In winter, when the braves went abroad they rubbed themselves
all over with bear's grease or beaver oil, treating in this
fashion, too, the furs they wore.</p>

<p>"They use," says one trader, "no milk from the time they
are weaned, and they all hate to taste Cheese, having taken
up an opinion that it was made of Dead Men's Fat." They
were fond of prunes and raisins, and would give a beaver skin
for twelve of them to carry to their children, and also for a
Jew's-harp or a tin trumpet. They were great admirers of
pictures or prints, giving a beaver for bad prints, and "all
toys were jewels to them."</p>

<p>A trader at a little later period writes: "Having been
fortunate enough to administer medical relief to one of these
Indians during their stay, I came to be considered as a
physician, and found that was a character held in high
veneration," and goes on to add that their solicitude and
credulity as to drugs and nostrums had exposed them to
gross deceptions on the part of the agents of the Hudson's
Bay Company. One of the chiefs informed him that he had
been at the Bay the year before and there purchased a quantity
of medicines which he would allow his visitor to inspect.
Accordingly, he fetched a bag containing numerous small
papers, in which he found lumps of white sugar, grains of
coffee, pepper, allspice, cloves, tea, nutmegs, ginger, and other
things of the kind, sold as specifics against evil spirits and
against the dangers of battle. These compounds were said to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
give power over enemies, particularly the white bear, of which
the Indians in those latitudes were much afraid; others were
infallible against barrenness in women, against difficult labour,
and against a variety of other afflictions.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Superstition
of the Indians.</p>

<p>It is related that some Indians, who were employed in the
vicinity of York Factory in a goose hunt, were so influenced
by superstition that they firmly believed the
devil, with hideous howlings, frequented their
tent every night. They came in a most dejected
state to the factory and related a lamentable tale to the
Governor, setting forth with much pathos, the distress they
were being subjected to by his Satanic majesty. So overcome
were they that they kept large fires burning all night,
sleeping only in the day time. One of the Red men
declared that he had discharged his gun at the monster,
but unluckily missed. The devil was described as of human
shape, with a capacity for enormous strides. The governor
treated the victims to a little brandy, and as if by magic
their courage rose. Investigation that same night disclosed
that the Satan was neither more nor less than a huge
night-owl.</p>

<p>The same trader also declares he found a number of small
prints, such as in England were commonly sold to children,
but which amongst the Indians were each transformed
into a talisman for the cure of some evil or for procuring
some delight. He even gives the mottoes on some of these,
and their specific uses: No. 1&mdash;"A sailor kissing his mistress
on his return from sea." This worn about the person
of a gallant attracted, though concealed, the affections of the
sex! No. 2&mdash;"A soldier in arms." Such a talisman poured
a sentiment of valour into its possessor and gave him the
strength of a giant!</p>

<p>It was alleged that by means of such commodities many
customers were secured to the Company, nor is there reason
to doubt it. "Even those Indians who shortened their
voyage by dealing with us, sent forward one canoe laden with
beaver-skins to purchase articles of this kind at Cumberland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
House." Henry adds that he was wise enough not to dispute
their value.</p>

<p>As time went on the Indians began to relinquish many of
the habits and customs, and even the appearance they presented,
before the advent of the white traders. Being in
constant communication with the factories, they became semi-civilized,
and took on many of the outer characteristics of the
European. They brought in year after year the spoils of
the chase in strict confidence, and there exchanged them
for the necessaries of life, which they no longer provided for
themselves. To all intents and purposes the tribes were in
the pay of the Company, or lived upon their bounty. It
was, therefore, to be expected that all originality would be
lost amongst them.</p>

<p>The principal things necessary for the support and satisfaction
of the Indian and his family in the middle of the
eighteenth century were: a gun, hatchet, ice chisel, brazil
fob, knives, files, flints, powder and shot, a powder horn, a
bayonet, a kettle, cloth, beads, etc.</p>

<p>It was early found that alcohol was a very dangerous
element to introduce amongst the savages. Talon had presented
the unhappy colony of New France with a statute
removing all the penalties and ordinances of which justice
and the authorities had made use to repress the disorders
caused by the too great quantity of liquor given to the
Indians.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Liking of the
Indians for
liquor.</p>

<p>The inclination of the Indians for intoxication, it was
pointed out to Colbert by an ecclesiastic who sought to alter
the condition of affairs, is much stronger than that of the
people of Europe. They have, urged he, greater weakness in
resisting it. "If in a bourgade there be liquor freely accessible
to the Indians, they usually all become intoxicated&mdash;old,
young, great and small, women and children, so that
there is hardly one left sober. If there were liquor sufficient
to last two days, drunkenness invariably continued two days.
If enough for a week, it would last a week; if for a
month, it would last a month. This," said the good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
priest, "is what we do not see in Europe&mdash;a whole city
get drunk, nor see it continue in that state for weeks and
months." It may readily be perceived that
those who wish to strike a bargain favourable
to themselves with the Indians, had only to
resort to liquor, and by that means, without
regard to their own salvation or that of the savages, could
generally procure what they desired at a small expenditure.</p>

<p>An Indian, it was said early in the next century, would
barter away all his furs, nay even leave himself without a rag
to cover his nakedness, in exchange for that vile, unwholesome
stuff called English brandy.</p>

<p>The Company in England having decided not to employ
liquor in its traffic with the Indians, the temptation was
strong upon Colbert and the French to resort to it. At one
of its meetings, in 1685, the Company listened to a paper
describing the methods in vogue by the French traders at the
important post of Tadoussac. At this fort or factory, for
more than twenty years previously, it was the custom to allow
an Indian a quart of wine; this fluid, although it boasted
such a title, hardly merited it. It was composed of one part
of brandy to five parts of water; a proportion which fluctuated,
it is true, but chiefly in respect of more water. To this
more or less fiery liquid was given at a little later date the
name high wine; and high wine figured largely in the
dealings of both French and English with the Indians for
more than two centuries. If an Indian desired more than
the regulation quart, he was put off until another time. The
necessary moderation was thus secured, and the trade suffered
no injury. Colbert expressed himself as afraid that if the
Quebec Company did not employ liquor the Indians would
carry their beavers to the Dutch. He need not, however,
have troubled himself with this apprehension, as it was the
Iroquois alone who could go there, and the French of Quebec
did small trade with this hostile nation. It was asserted that
the French would not lose five hundred skins a year by
preserving the moderation necessary for Christianity, and
the good morality of the colony.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Effect of intoxication
on
the Indians.</p>

<p>Excess of liquor frequently made Europeans merry and
gay; on the Indian, however, it had a contrary effect.
Under its influence he recalled his departed friends and relations,
lamenting their death with abundance of tears. Should
he be near their graves he would often resort thither and weep
there. Others would join the chorus in a song, even though
quite unable to hold up their heads. It was not uncommon
for them to roll about their tents in a fit of frenzy, frequently
falling into the blazing fire. Quarrelling then
was common: an ancient disagreement, long
forgotten, being revived. The chiefs had often
the prudence, when matters were going this
way, to order the women to remove all offensive weapons out
of the tent. But one weapon, very effective, the teeth, still
remained; and it was not unusual to see several braves the
next morning without a nose, an ear, or a finger. In affrays
such as these, no respect whatever was paid to the ties of
blood, brothers and sisters often fighting with great spirit and
animosity. At the conclusion of one of these encounters
early in the eighteenth century, an Indian entered York Factory
one morning and desired to be admitted to the surgeon.
He was conducted to the surgeon's room; he saluted its
inmate in broken English, with "Look here, man; here my
nose," at the same time holding out his palm, which contained
half that desirable facial adjunct. This he desired the surgeon,
having a mighty opinion of the faculty, to restore. The
man's nephew had, it seems, bit it off; he declared he felt no
pain, nor was he sensible of his loss till awaking the next
morning he found the piece lying by his side.</p>

<br />
1685-1742.</h2>

followed by Debauch&mdash;Gifts to the Chief&mdash;He makes
a Speech to the Governor&mdash;Ceremony of the Pipe&mdash;Trading Begun.
</p>

<p>The tribes to the west of the Bay led an erratic life.
They were without horses, and it was their custom never to
remain above a fortnight in one spot, unless they found plenty
of game.</p>

<p>When they had encamped, and their lodges were built, they
dispersed to hunt, meeting in the evening when they had procured
enough to maintain them during the day. It was not
their custom to travel more than three or four miles from
their lodges, but when scarcity of game was encountered they
would remove a league or two farther off. In this fashion
they traversed the whole forest region, hardly missing a
single day winter or summer, fair or foul, but always employed
in some kind of chase.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Indians
as hunters.</p>

<p>The Indians were ruthless slaughterers of animals at the
earliest period at which they were known to the servants of
the Company. Whether they happened to be under the
pinch of necessity or enjoying themselves in
all the happiness of health and plenty, it was
their custom to slay all they could. They
boasted a maxim that the "more they killed, the more they
had to kill." Such an opinion, although opposed to reason
and common sense, was clung to with great pertinacity by
them. The results of this indiscriminate slaughter were
obvious; and to such a pitch of destitution were the tribes
often brought that cannibalism was not infrequent amongst
them.</p>

<p>The species of game, such as marten, squirrel and ermine,
got by traps and snares, were generally caught by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
women and children. When the men had slain their elks,
deer, or buffalo, or foxes, they left it where it fell, leaving the
squaws to fetch it to the lodges the next day, taking care to
cut off the titbits or tender morsels, such as tongues, for their
own immediate pleasure.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0247" id="im_0247"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Modern Type of Indian.</span></p>
</div>

<p>A great part of the factory provisions consisted of geese
killed by the Indians. For this purpose the factors supplied
the latter with powder and shot, allowing them the value of a
beaver skin for every ten geese killed. Accordingly, after the
Indian had got his supply, he set off from his tent early in
the morning into the marshes, where he sat himself down
with great patience, difficult of imitation by the Company's
men, and there, sheltered by willows, waited for the geese.
These were shot flying, and so dexterous were the braves at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
this sport that a good hunter would kill, in times of plenty,
fifty or sixty a day. Few Europeans were able to endure
the cold, hunger and adversity which often marked these
excursions.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Meeting at
Lake
Winnipeg.</p>

<p>The nations coming from a distance to York Factory were
wont to assemble in May at Lake Winnipeg to the number
of perhaps fifteen hundred. The chief would then harangue
the men, representing their wants, and exhort
the young men to exert themselves to the utmost
to reach the fort with all their skins and to
secure good terms from the white men. Each
family then made a feast, in the course of which they fixed
upon those of their number who were to undertake the
journey. During the progress of the wassail which then
reigned, it was customary for speeches to be made, new
alliances formed and old ones strengthened. The morrow
was spent in building the birch bark canoes, in which the
northern tribes had attained great proficiency; and being
at last ready for the voyage, the leaders of the expedition
were chosen, and all was ready to start.</p>

<p>It was never exactly ascertained how many actually participated
in these trading expeditions; the number was regulated
by the circumstance of the tribes being at peace or at war,
and also whether disease raged amongst them. It may be
taken, roughly speaking, that six hundred canoes containing
one thousand persons, not counting women, came down
annually to York Factory, with furs to trade.</p>

<p>No regularity marked their voyage, each striving to be foremost,
because those proceeding first had the best chance of
procuring food. During the voyage each leader canvassed,
with all manner of art and diligence, for braves to join his
party. Some were influenced by presents, and others by
promises, for the more canoes each petty leader had under his
command the greater he appeared at the factory.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Difficulties
of the
journey.</p>

<p>Throughout their progress the Indians were obliged to
go ashore for several hours daily, which caused great delay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
in their progress. Their canoes were small, holding only
two men and a pack of one hundred beaver
skins, with not much room for provisions. Had
their canoes been larger their voyages would
undoubtedly have been less protracted, and they
would have been able to transport a greater cargo. Often
great numbers of skins were left behind.</p>

<p>A good hunter of these nations could kill six hundred
beavers in the course of a season; he could carry down to the
factory rarely more than one hundred, using the remainder
at home in various ways. Sometimes he hung them upon
branches of trees by way of votive offering upon the death of
a child or near relation; often they were utilized as bedding
and bed coverings; occasionally the fur was burnt off, and the
beast roasted whole for food at banquets.</p>

<p>These annual journeys were beset by much hardship and
suffering even at the best of times.</p>

<p>The testimony of at least one Governor is significant.
"While," said he, "it is the duty of every one of the Company's
servants to encourage a spirit of industry among the natives,
and to use every means in their power to induce them to
procure furs and other commodities for trade ... at the
same time, it must be confessed that such conduct is by no
means for the real benefit of the poor Indians; it being well-known
that those who have the least intercourse with the
factories, are by far the happiest.... It is true that there
are few Indians but have once in their lives, at least, visited
the fort, and the hardships and dangers which most of them
experienced on those occasions have left such a lasting
impression on their minds, that nothing can induce them to
repeat their visits."</p>

<p>Arriving near their journey's end, they all put ashore; the
women going into the woods to gather pine-brush for the
bottom of the tents, while the leaders smoked together and
arranged the procession to the factory. This settled, they
re-embarked, and soon after arrived before the post of the
Company; if there happened to be but one captain, his situation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
was in the centre of all the canoes; if more than one,
they placed themselves at the wings, their canoes being
distinguished by a small flag hoisted on a stick and placed
astern. Arriving within two hundred yards of the palisade,
they discharged their fowling pieces by way of compliment
to the Governor, who returned the salute by firing off two or
three small cannon. The men of the tribe seldom concerned
themselves with taking out the bundles, except occasionally
when the younger ones assisted the women.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Type of Cree Indian.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">Arrival
at the
Fort.</p>

<p>The factor being now informed that the Indians had
arrived, the trader was sent to introduce the leaders into the
fort. Chairs were placed in the trading-room for the visitors,
and pipes introduced. During the first part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
ceremony the leader puffed great clouds of smoke, but said
little; but the tobacco in the bowl becoming low, he began
to be more talkative. Fixing his eyes immovably
on the ground, he informed the factors how
many canoes he had brought, and what tribes
he had seen; he enquired after the health of his
hosts, and declared he is glad to see them. When this speech
was concluded the Governor bade the chief and his party
welcome, informing him that he had good goods and plenty,
that he loved the Indians, and they might count upon his
kindness to them. The pipe was then removed, and the
conversation became general.</p>

<p>During this visit the chief was dressed out at the Company's
expense. He was furnished with a coarse cloth coat,
red or blue, lined with baize, and white regimental cuffs; a
waistcoat and breeches of baize. This suit was ornamented
with orris lace. He was likewise presented with a white
or checked cotton shirt, stockings of yarn, one red and the
other blue, and tied below the knee with worsted garters; his
moccasins were sometimes put on over these, but he as freely
walked away in bare feet. His hat was of coarse felt and
bedecked with three ostrich feathers, of various colours. A
worsted sash was fastened to its crown; a small silk handkerchief
drawn about his neck, and thus attired, the chief
strutted up and down delighted.</p>

<p>His second in command also claimed attention. He was
given a coat, but not a lined one; a shirt and a cap
such as was worn by sailors of the period. The guests once
equipped, bread and prunes were forthcoming and set before
the chief; and of these confections he took care to fill his
pockets before they were carried out. These were followed
by a two-gallon keg of brandy, pipes and tobacco for himself
and followers.</p>

<p>It was now high time to think of returning to the camp,
but this exit was not to be undertaken without further marks
of the favour and esteem with which the chief was held by the
Company. His conduct from the fort was effected in state.
In front a halberd and ensign were borne; next came a
drummer beating a march, followed by several of the factory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
servants bearing bread, prunes, pipes, tobacco, brandy, etc.
Behind these came the "King," "Captain," or chief, with
stately tread, and erect, smoking his pipe and conversing with
the factors at his side. Afterwards came the "Lieutenant,"
"Prince," relative or friend, who had accompanied the chief.</p>

<p>The tent was found ready for their reception, strewn with
clean pine brush and beaver coats placed for them to sit.
The brandy was deposited on the ground, and the chief gave
orders for its distribution. After this the factor left, none
too soon, however, for all were soon plunged into a brutal
state of intoxication. "It is fifty to one," writes one trader,
"but some one is killed before morning. They give loose
rein to every species of disorderly tumult&mdash;all crying, fighting,
and dancing."</p>

<p>About 1735, a party of Indians came down to trade, and
the first day of their arrival, as was their invariable custom,
got vilely drunk. While thus inebriated, they fought, not
noisily, but silently, in the darkness. When morning dawned,
two corpses, in a fearful state of mutilation, were found
stretched on the ground in pools of blood.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Ceremony
of the pipe.</p>

<p>After this debauch, which lasted about two or three days,
the sobered braves took to the calumet of peace. The stem
of this pipe was three or four feet long, decorated
with pieces of lace, bears' claws, eagles'
talons, and the feathers of the most beautiful
birds. The pipe being affixed to the stem, the factor took
it in both hands, and with great gravity rose from his chair
and pointed the end of the stem to the east or sunrise,
and then to the zenith, and to the west, and then perpendicularly
to the Nadir. After this he took three or four
hearty whiffs and then presented it to the chief, and so on
round the whole party, the women excepted. When the
tobacco was consumed, the factor took the pipe again and
twirling it three times round his head, laid it with great
deliberation on the table. A great Ho! was thereupon
emitted from the mouths of the assemblage.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p>This ceremony being over, a further gratuity of bread and
prunes was distributed, and the chief made a speech, which
one trader has reported, after this style.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0253" id="im_0253"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">An Old Chief.</span><br />
(<i>From a Photograph.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>"You told me last year to bring many Indians to trade,
which I promised to do. You see, I have not lied, here are
many young men come with me; use them kindly, I say; let
them trade good goods, I say. We lived hard last winter and
were hungry; powder being short measure and bad, I say.
Tell your servants to fill the measure, and not put their
thumbs within the brim; take pity on us, take pity on
us, I say.</p>

<p>"We paddle a long way to see you; we love the English.
Let us trade good black tobacco, moist and hard twisted; let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
us see it before it is opened. Take pity on us, take pity
on us, I say.</p>

<p>"The guns are bad, let us trade light guns, small in the
hand and well-shaped, and locks that will not freeze in the
winter, and red gun-cases. Let the young men have more
than measure of tobacco, cheap pattees, thick and high.</p>

<p>"Give us good measure of cloth; let us see the old
measure. The young men love you by coming so far to see
you. Give them good goods; they like to dress and be fine;
do you see?"</p>

<p>As soon as the chief had finished the above speech, he, with
his followers, proceeded to examine the guns and tobacco; the
former with a most minute attention. This over, they traded
with furs promiscuously, the leader being so far indulged as to
be admitted into the trading-room all the time if he desired it.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Varieties of
beaver.</p>

<p>The beaver thus received by the chief trader and stored at
the factory pending its shipment to England in the Company's
ships, was classified into eight varieties. The first was
the fat winter beaver, slain in winter, which was valued at five
shillings and sixpence a pound. The second sort was the fat
summer beaver, worth two shillings and ninepence. Next
came in order the dry winter beaver, and the Bordeaux, both
worth three shillings and sixpence. The dry
summer beaver, not much valued, about one
shilling and ninepence. Sixth came the coat
beaver, as it was called, which brought four shillings and
sixpence. The Muscovite, dry beaver of a fine skin, covered
with a silky hair; it was worn in Russia, where the short fur
was combed away and manufactured into fabric, leaving only
the hair; this fetched four and sixpence; and lastly on the
list figured the Mittain beaver, which were utilized in the
manufacture of mittens, being worth one shilling and ninepence.</p>

<p>It was reported that in the year 1742 the natives were so
discouraged in their trade with the Company that many
found the peltry hardly worth the carriage, and the finest
furs sold for very little. When the tribes came to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
factory in June they found the goods much higher in price,
and much in excess of the standard they were accustomed to.
According to Joseph la France, a French-Canadian voyageur,
they gave but a pound of gunpowder for four beavers, a
fathom of tobacco for seven beavers, a pound of shot for one,
an ell of coarse cloth for fifteen, a blanket for twelve, two fish-hooks
or three flints for one, a gun for twenty-five, a pistol for
ten; a common hat with white lace cost seven beavers, an axe
four, a bill-hook one, a gallon of brandy four, a chequered
shirt seven; "all of which sold at a monstrous profit, even to
two thousand per cent."</p>

<p>It was a fact, nevertheless, that notwithstanding such discouragement
the two expeditions of Indians who visited York
and Churchill that year brought down two hundred packs of
one hundred each, that is to say twenty thousand beaver
skins. As to the other Indians who arrived from another
direction, they carried three hundred packs of one hundred
each, which made a total of fifty thousand beavers, besides
nine thousand martens.</p>

</p>

<p>It has already been observed how fearful had grown the
demoralization of the Indians, chiefly through the instrumentality
and example of the <i>coureur des bois</i>. This class seemed
daily to grow more corrupt, and bade fair to throw off the
last vestige of restraint and become merged in all the iniquity,
natural and acquired, of the savage races. We have seen,
too, how the missionaries intervened, and implored the civil
authorities to institute some sort of reform. It was at their
solicitation that the Government of Canada at length decided
to re-adopt the system of licenses, and to grant the privileges
of exclusive trade to retired army officers, to each of whom
they accorded a certain fur-bearing district by way of recompense
for services rendered by him. In order that the trader
might be protected against hostile assault, permission was
given to establish forts in certain places suitable for their
construction.</p>

<p>One of the French Canadian youth, whom the exploits of
Iberville against the Hudson's Bay Company had fired with
a spirit of emulation and who was head and shoulders above
all that race of soldiers turned fur-traders, who now began
to spread themselves throughout the great west&mdash;was Pierre
Gaultier de Varennes, Sieur de la Verandrye.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Sieur de
Verandrye.</p>

<p>This gallant soldier and intrepid explorer, to whose memory
history has as yet done but scant justice, was born at Three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
Rivers on the 17th of November, 1685. At an early age
he embraced the profession of arms, and at
twenty-four fought so valorously against Marlborough's
forces at Malplaquet that, pierced by
nine wounds, he was left for dead upon the field of battle.
Recovering, however, he returned to the colony, and at
twenty-seven married the daughter of the Seigneur d'Isle
Dupas, by whom he had four sons. These sons were all
destined to be associated with their father in the subsequent
explorations in Rupert's Land and the west.</p>

<p>At the hour when Verandrye was seized with his zeal for
exploration and discovery, the Company's rivals already
possessed numerous posts established by Iberville, Duluth,
Frontenac and Denonville, and a host of lesser lights, in the
west. Of one of these, on the shores of Lake Nepigon, at
the extreme end of Lake Superior, Verandrye had been
given the command.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Verandrye
sets out
to explore the
West.</p>

<p>While at this fort, a rumour had reached him of a mighty
river flowing into the great ocean. Credulous of the truth of
this report, borne to him by the Indians, Verandrye
lost little time in communicating it to a
friend, Father de Gonor, at Michilimackinac. It
was shortly thereafter carried to Governor Beauharnois,
who was induced, but not without
much pleading, to grant Verandrye fifty men and a missionary
for the purposes of exploration. But, although he
had thus far succeeded, the only pecuniary aid upon which
the explorer could rely was from the fur-trade. He was
accordingly given a license to trade, and on the strength of
this concession, certain merchants advanced him an outfit.
He set out and arrived at Rainy Lake in September, 1731,
traversed it, and erected a fort near the site of the present
Fort Francis of a later day, to which he gave the name of
St. Peter.</p>

<p>A year later he built another fort on the western shore of
the Lake of the Woods, and in 1733 paddled down to the
mouth of the Winnipeg River to the lake of that name.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
Crossing Lake Winnipeg, he ascended the Assiniboine River
and constructed Fort Rouge.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>In 1738 the explorer's three sons, under their sire's instructions,
made their way up the Assiniboine and built Fort la
Reine, on the site of the present Portage la Prairie.</p>

<p>Well may it be said that the five years from 1733 to 1738
were years of cruel grief and disappointment for Verandrye.
He had been struggling on to a realization of his dream in
spite of the bitterest discouragements. One of his sons had
been slain by the Sioux; he was without funds; fur-trading
being with him only a subsidiary employment. His men
lacking both courage and faith became unmanageable, and
Verandrye addressed the most affecting letters to his monarch
in France, who looked upon him and his schemes coldly.
Those merchants, who had advanced him money, loaded him
with their distrust, perpetually harassed him for returns, and
loudly demanded his recall, so that he was forced to stand
still and engage in barter when his whole soul cried aloud for
him to press on in his path and reach the Pacific.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Verandrye's
son reaches
the Rockies.</p>

<p>Verandrye divided his little party in the spring of 1742
and ascended the Souris River. Those who came to be
familiar with the territory in a later day, when it was frequented
by traders, might well appreciate what were the perils
these pioneers encountered, and what dangers they escaped
when they finally left the country of the peace&mdash;leaving
Ojibways at Red River, and struck off into the land of
the Sioux, a tribe then, from their ferocity to the whites,
called the "tigers of the plains." But they were to go still
farther. Already the eldest son of the explorer had reached
the tribe of the Mandans in the Missouri, but owing to
inability to obtain guides his party had been forced to return.
He was again despatched by his father, this time in company
with the younger son, known as the Chevalier, and two other
Frenchmen into the unknown country to the west. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
little band of four made a journey of several hundred miles,
entering into a league with one of the nations into whose
country they penetrated, to lead them to the
great Western Ocean. On the first day of
January, 1743, they beheld, the first amongst
white men, the eastern spurs of the northern
Rocky Mountains. But here the Bow Indians, their guides,
deserted them, and surrounded by hostile tribes, the party was
forced to return. It was in this same year that the elder
Verandrye, scarred and gaunt from his long wanderings in the
wilderness, presented himself at Quebec to confront his
enemies and traducers. They had represented as making
an enormous fortune and leading an idle life, he who could
point proudly to having taken possession of the country of
the Upper Missouri for Lewis XV., and who had built a
score and more of forts in the unknown regions of the
West.</p>

<p>"If 40,000 livres of debt that I have over my head," said
Verandrye bitterly, "are an advantage, then I can compliment
myself on being very rich, and I would have been much more
so in the end, if I had continued."</p>

<p>His license was given to another who, however, made a poor
showing by means of it, and it was not until Beauharnois's
successor investigated Verandrye's claims that the explorer
received some recognition at court. He was given a captaincy
and the Cross of St. Lewis.</p>

<p>But the explorer had not waited for this. He had been
pushing on in his work, and in 1748 ascended the Saskatchewan.
The progress of the French was marked by more forts,
one in Lake Dauphin and another called Bourbon at the
extremity of his discoveries. Verandrye was about to cross
the Rocky Mountains when death overtook him, on the
6th of December, 1749.</p>

<p>The sons of Verandrye were eager to continue his work
and attain at last the Pacific. But Bigot, the Intendant, was
not their friend; he had other plans, and the Verandryes were
deposed by favourites with not half their ability or their claims
to honours and rewards. But they had paved the way and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
now the French were reaping the profits of the fur-trade in
the North-West on a great scale.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Verandrye's
work.</p>

<p>Thus were successively established, from 1731 to 1748, by
Verandrye and his sons, Fort St. Pierre on Rainy Lake; Fort
St. Charles on the Lake of the Woods; Fort
Maurepas near the mouth of the Winnipeg; Fort
Dauphin, on the north-west extremity of Lake
Manitoba; Fort la Reine, on the southern extremity of the
last-named lake; Fort Rouge, at the confluence of the Assiniboine
and Red River; Fort Bourbon, at the head of Lake
Winnipeg; Fort Poskoyae, on the Saskatchewan, and Fort
Lacerne (Nipawi), at the forks of the said river.</p>

<p>In 1752, some years prior to the conquest of Canada, a
relative of Verandrye, named Niverville, established Fort Jonquiere
at the foot of the mountains.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Which of all these forts
were to pass, after many vicissitudes, into the hands of the
Hudson's Bay Company, we shall see in the course of subsequent
pages. Verandrye and his compeers chose their sites
with great care and ability; so that it was rarely that their
successors were able to improve upon them. On the foundations
or charred remnants of the French forts, should the
structures themselves have perished, the English fur-traders,
when they came, reared anew their posts.</p>

<p>While thus the French were pressing forward from the south
and east at the same moment, a new rivalry threatened to
spring up in the far north-west.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Russia looks
toward the
New World.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century broke upon an abated zeal of the
Spaniards in extending their discoveries and dominions in the
New World. Almost contemporaneously, the
threads they threw down were grasped by another
power, which the zeal and energy of one
man had suddenly transformed from a collection
of savage, barbarous tribes into a great nation.
Having achieved conquest over his neighbours and the cohesion
of his new empire, Peter the Great turned his attention to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
a hardly inferior task. None knew as yet whether the two great
continents, Asia and North America, united on the north-east.
During Peter's residence in England, not the least of the
institutions interesting him was the Hudson's Bay Company.
A letter from Peter is quoted by a Russian writer, in which
he alludes to the English rivalry for these trades "which had
so long been the monopoly of Muscovy fur-hunting and fur-gathering."
Doubtless even at this time he was speculating
upon the chances of Russia competing with England for the
fur traffic of the New World. But before such a competition
could be brought about the question of the geographical connection
between Asia and America must be settled. When he
had been in Holland in 1717, he had been urged by some of
the most eminent patrons of discovery amongst the Dutch to
institute an expedition of investigation. But again other
matters intervened; although in 1727 two Russian officers
were equipped and in readiness to start overland when they
were recalled for service in Sweden.</p>

<p>Not until he was on his death-bed did Czar Peter pen with
his own hand the instructions to Admiral Aproxin which
bore fruit later. It was then, too, that the idea, according
to Lestkof, was discussed of a Russian Fur Company,
similar in its methods and organization to the Hudson's Bay
Company.</p>

<p>Peter directed first that one or two boats with decks should
be built at Kamschatka, or in the vicinity; that with these a
survey should be made of the most northerly coasts of his
Asiatic Empire, to determine whether they were or were not
contiguous to America. Also that the persons to whom the
expedition might be entrusted should endeavour to ascertain
whether there was any port in those regions belonging to
Europe, and to keep a strict look-out for any European ship,
taking care also to employ some skilful men in making
enquiries regarding the names and situation of the coasts
which they discovered. They were to keep an exact journal
and to transmit it to St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>Peter died, but the Empress Catherine, his successor, was
equally favourable to the scheme, and gave orders to fit out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
the expedition. To Captain Vitus Bering was entrusted the
command. Under him were two lieutenants, Martin Spangberg
and Alexi Tchirikoff; and besides other subalterns were
several excellent ship-carpenters.</p>

<p>On February 5, 1735, they set out from St. Petersburg, and
on March 16 arrived at Tobolsk, the capital of Siberia.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bering's
discoveries.</p>

<p>Bering returned from his first voyage satisfied that he had
reached the utmost limits of Asia, and that no junction with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
America existed. Some years elapsed, and in 1741 Bering,
Spangberg and Tchirikoff again volunteered.
This expedition was destined to prove fatal to
the explorer; he got lost in a fog, intense cold
prevailed, scurvy broke out amongst the men, and on a little
island in Bering's Sea he breathed his last.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0263" id="im_0263"></a>

<p>Although many years were to elapse before the Russians
took any more active steps, they had, by virtue of Bering's
discoveries, got a footing on the North American Continent,
and were thus already neighbours, if not yet rivals, of the
Hudson's Bay Company.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>"It is very evident," wrote one of the contemporary chroniclers,
"that for upwards of two centuries and a half an
opinion has prevailed amongst the most knowing and experienced
persons, that there is a passage to the north-west,
and this built partly upon science, partly upon tradition.
Now, it is very hard to conceive how such an opinion should
maintain its credit if it was not founded in reality; for it is
an old and true maxim that specious opinions endure but a
short time, whereas truth is everlasting."</p>

<p>For many years the notion of a north-west passage had
slept; but in 1737 it again attracted public attention. In
that year Arthur Dobbs, a gentleman of some means and of
scientific bent, made formal application to the Hudson's Bay
Company that a search be undertaken. Upon his representations
the Company sent forth two of their ships upon the
quest. These, the <i>Churchill</i> and the <i>Musquash</i> went, however,
no farther north than latitude 62° 15' and returned without
seeing anything worthy of notice, save "a number of
small islands, abundance of black whales, but no very great
tides, the highest about two fathoms, the flood coming from
the northward."</p>

<p>There had been for a great many years in the Company's
employ an able mariner, Captain Christopher Middleton.
For some reason or other Middleton had become dissatisfied
with their service and one of his friends placed him in communication
with the patron of discovery, Dobbs, and a close
correspondence ensued.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Dobbs was eager to employ Middleton in a search for the
long-sought straits. This was by no means an easy matter.
In the first place the Company flatly declined to participate in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
the scheme, alleging that they had already done enough in
that direction<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and that the whole idea was a fallacy.</p>

<p>There was no north-west passage to India, and the sooner
the public mind divested itself of the folly of supposing one
existed the better it would be for the public purse and the
public wisdom.</p>

<p>The Company pointed out that if Middleton should winter
at either of the Company's factories it might drive the natives
to trade with the French, who were always on the alert; and
trade so lost would never return or be regained. They begged
the Admiralty to restrain Captain Middleton from interfering
with the Company's trade and invading their property and
rights.</p>

<p>Dobbs, however, secured from the Admiralty for Middleton's
use the bomb ketch <i>Furnace</i>, which, with another small vessel,
the <i>Welcome</i>, was ready to sail early in June.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Company
opposes
further
exploration.</p>

<p>So opposed do the Company appear to have their domains
meddled with by these fruitless explorations that they sent
out a letter to their Governor at Churchill, which was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
most convenient harbour for the explorers to winter in, not
to receive Middleton into their fort. Dobbs
and his friends getting wind of this, complained
to the Admiralty, who wrote to the Honourable
Adventurers in a tone of decided reproof,
observing that even if Middleton were to receive
assistance and provisions, payment would be made for these
to the Company on the return of the expedition to England.</p>

<p>After deliberating for some time, the Company thereupon
wrote to the Lords of the Admiralty, saying that they had
sent a further letter to Governor Norton requiring him to
extend the necessary hospitality to Middleton. That the sort
of hospitality the Company was prepared to dispense was not
of too warm a character may be adjudged from the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">Hudson's Bay House, London</span>, May 15, 1741.</p>

<p><i>Mr. James Isham and Council</i>,<br />
<span class="i4"><i>Prince of Wales' Fort, Churchill River</i>:</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;Notwithstanding our orders to you, if Captain
Middleton (who is sent abroad in the Government's service to discover a
passage north-west) should by inevitable necessity be brought into real
distress and danger of his life and loss of his ship, in such case you are
then to give him the best assistance and relief you can.</p>
</div>

<p>A duplicate of this was put in Middleton's possession, who
still dissatisfied, rushed off instantly with it to Whitehall.
It was deemed necessary to apply to the Lords of the
Regency that the Secretary of State might, by their orders,
write to the Company to request the assistance they refused
to the Admiralty. The Company, thus hemmed in, gave a
letter couched in a more friendly style.</p>

<p>"It is plain," remarks a contemporary writer, "that the
Company believe there is a passage, which they want to
conceal; for otherwise it would have been their interest to
have the attempt made. If not found there would have been
an end to prosecuting it any further, and they might probably
have enjoyed their trade to the Bay, without its being
coveted or enquired into."</p>

<p>Middleton owned to Dobbs that just before his departure
the Company had endeavoured to bribe him with an offer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
£5,000 to return to their service, or that if he was determined
to go, to pursue the voyage by Davis' Straits, or by any other
way than the west of the Bay. They alleged that it would
cost the Company that amount to support their right against
the Crown and against private adventurers, and that "as he
had been their friend, and knew all their concerns, it would
be better to give him that sum than to give it to their
lawyers." The Company did not deny that such an offer
had been made by two or three of the committee privately.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Middleton
explores for a
north-west
passage.</p>

<p>Middleton now proceeded on his journey in quest of the
famed north-west passage. It is charged that on his arrival
in the Bay he never once went ashore or sent
his boat to search for any inlet or to try the
tide. He tried the current in latitude 63° 20',
and found it very rapid, in spite of the fact
that there existed a great deal of ice to the
northward. Its presence compelled him to stand off from
shore until he passed Cape Dobbs, beyond which he found
an opening northwestward. In this opening he sought shelter
for three weeks.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Trouble
between
Middleton and
his men.</p>

<p>No voyage of discovery since the world began was ever
made under such circumstances. Numerous members of the
crew, who had got wind of the situation, were filled, or professed
to be filled, with distrust of their captain. Caring
nothing about the voyage itself or the object for which it was
undertaken, they entered with zeal a hundred times a day
into plots to make the commander's life unbearable. The
supposed passage was christened the "Forbidden Straits,"
and the crews vastly amused themselves with Middleton's
supposed discomfiture. Several were very nearly yard-armed
for spreading reports that the captain had purposely sailed
past the straits. Sometimes the captain merely laughed at
the views of his subordinates; at other times, it is said, he
flew into a temper, and indulged in threats and abuse. Once,
when from the number of whales and the breadth and depth
of the river, word sped from mouth to mouth that it was a
strait they were in, and no river, "he rated several of them for
pretending to say so against his opinion, saying his clerk was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
a double-tongued rascal, that he would cane the lieutenant,
broomstick the master, and lash any others who would concern
themselves about the voyage." It was, moreover,
charged against Middleton that he interdicted
the keeping of private journals, and that if any
disobeyed this order he threatened to break
open their boxes and get possession of such
records. Once when the lieutenants and masters
were absent down the river to look for a cove for the
ships, Middleton grimly observed that he supposed the
former would bring back "some romantick account of a strait
or passage." Nevertheless, for his part, he would not take
the ships a foot farther. Intrigue characterized the whole of
this voyage of discovery.</p>

<p>The officers of both the <i>Furnace</i> and the <i>Discovery</i> took
turns in making jaunts into the country. On the 8th of
August, Captain Middleton, the clerk, gunner, and carpenter
went ashore at Cape Frigid, and after pacing some fifteen
miles into the country, returned, to find the ship drifted,
although it lacked some hours of high water. Rankin and
the men on board from this had become convinced that it was
the effects of the flood from the supposed strait. The captain
laughed them to scorn, and said that if it came from any
strait at all it was Hudson's Strait.</p>

<p>Two northern Indians were taken on board the <i>Discovery</i>,
and Thompson, the surgeon, who could speak some of the
southern tongue, began busying himself making a vocabulary
of their language. At this innocent occupation he was
observed by Middleton, who threatened to "crop him" in
case he persisted. When they reached Marble Island,
although the two Indians were desirous of going to England,
he put the pair ashore in a bad boat they were ignorant of how
to manage. The supplications of the unhappy savages were
useless to turn the Company's captain from his purpose. In
vain they told him that the island was three leagues from the
mainland, and a hundred miles from their own country; that
it was inhabited by the Esquimaux, their enemies.</p>

<p>"The Captain gave them some provisions, ammunition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
hatchets and toys. The excuse he made for not bringing
them to England was, that upon his return his friends might
be out of the Admiralty, and as he had no orders to take
them home, they would be left a charge upon him." This
was plausible, but Middleton's detractors did not rest there.
They accused the captain of saying that he was afraid the
Indians, when they learned to speak English, would be talking
of the copper mine and the north-west passage, and
would thereby put the public to the expense of sending out
more ships in quest of it. "And this, no doubt," commented
Dobbs, "was the true reason for that piece of cruelty, for he
thought if they came to England he should <i>not be able to
conceal the passage</i>."</p>

<p>On Middleton's return, after his quest, he was accused of
saying, "My character is so well established as a discoverer
that no man will ever, hereafter, attempt to discover the
north-west passage."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Middleton
returns
without
discovering
the passage.</p>

<p>He certainly received a cordial invitation from the Government,
the Admiralty and the Court. Immediately upon his
arrival in London he communicated with several of the partners
of the Hudson's Bay Company. The preparation of his
journal occupied for a time his leisure. "He himself," says
Dobbs, "had got great reputation from the Royal Society for
his observations upon cold; and for what he had discovered
had got a medal from them. He was upon good terms with
the Lords of the Admiralty, and was to dedicate his charts
and discoveries to the King and noblemen of the first rank as
well as to the Lords of the Admiralty." That the Lords of
the Admiralty were perfectly satisfied with his conduct, there
is every reason to believe, as in the following year Middleton
was placed in command of the <i>Shark</i>, a sloop.
All this naturally put him into a position to
serve those under him. All his recommendations
for promotion only strengthened the
suspicions gathering in the mind of Dobbs and
his fellow-patrons. "He had recommended
also his lieutenant, and thought none other on board had
weight enough to impeach his proceedings, which, if they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
failed in, would ruin their characters; so that securing his
officers, he thought all things would be safe amongst the
crew. But Middleton was not one to forget the patron and
prime mover of the expedition, whom he endeavoured to
propitiate by sending him an abstract of his journal. This
abstract seemed, to Dobbs, to be so full of contradictions and
discrepancies, that he wrote to the explorer to send him,
if possible, the journal itself. He had scarcely dispatched
this communication when he received a letter from Lanrick,
"a gentleman who had been bred a scholar," who had
accompanied Middleton on the voyage. It was substantially
the same account rendered by the captain, with this added
paragraph:</p>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;This account I should have sent you before now but
that the Captain, for reasons to himself best known, desired
that none of us should say anything about it relating to the
discovery for a little."</p>

<p>This very natural desire on the part of an explorer, about
to become an author, seems to have been fraught with
deep and incriminating significance to Dobbs. After a
short time the whole of Middleton's journal reached him;
it appeared to confirm all Dobbs's presentiments.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Suspicion
attaches to
Middleton.</p>

<p>Dobbs and the other patrons were therefore convinced that
Middleton had played them false for the Hudson's Bay
Company; and their belief in a north-west passage was
strengthened rather than weakened. In their report, after
going over the whole account of the voyage furnished them,
they were especially severe upon Middleton. "His whole
conduct," they said, "from his going to Churchill until his
return to England, and even since his return,
it will appear plainly that he intended to serve
the Company at the public expense, and contrived
everything so as to stifle the discovery,
and to prevent others from undertaking it for the future so as
to secure the favour of the Company and the reward they
said they promised him before he began the voyage."</p>

<p>An informer appeared, who testified that Middleton had
declared in presence of the others at a council held at York
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
Factory, Churchill, that he "should be able to make the
voyage, but none on board should be any the wiser and he
would be a better friend to the Company than ever."</p>

<p>Middleton was charged in public with neglect in having
failed to explore the line of coast which afforded a probability
of a passage to the north-west. The principal points at
issue appear to have been in respect to the discovery by
Middleton, of the Wager River, Repulse Bay, and the
Frozen Strait. In this century Sir Edward Parry has
remarked: "The accuracy of Captain Middleton is manifest
upon the point most strenuously argued against him, for our
subsequent experience has not left the smallest doubt of
Repulse Bay and the northern part of the Welcome being
filled by a rapid tide flowing into it from the eastward
through the Frozen Strait." Dobbs, fully impressed with a
conviction that the captain's story of the Frozen Strait was
all chimera, as well as everything Middleton had said concerning
that part of the voyage, confidently insisted on the
probability of the tide finding its way through Wager River,
or at least through some arm of the sea communicating with
that inlet from the westward.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>One detail only was lacking to render the situation farcical&mdash;an
anonymous letter. This reached Dobbs on the 21st of
January, and ran in this absurd vein:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"This script is only open to your Eyes, which have been sealed or
closed with too much (we cannot say Cunning) Artifice, so as they have
not been able to discover our Discoverer's Pranks. All Nature cries aloud
that there is a Passage, and we are sure there is one from Hudson's Bay
to Japan. Send a letter directed to Messieurs Brook and Cobham, who
are Gentlemen who have been the Voyage, and cannot bear so Glorious
an Attempt, should die under the Hands of Mercenary Wretches, and
they will give you such pungent reasons as will awaken all your Industry.
They desire it may be kept secret so long as they shall think fit; they are
willing to venture their Lives, their Fortunes, their All, in another
attempt; and they are no inconsiderable persons, but such as have had it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
much at heart ever since they saw the Rapidity of Tides in the Welcome.
The frozen straits is all Chimera, and everything you have yet read or seen
concerning that part of our Voyage, We shall send you some unanswerable
Queries. Direct for us at the Chapter Coffee House, St Paul's
Churchyard, London."
</p>
</div>

<p>It was now clear that Middleton's voyage had been made in
vain, and that another would shortly be attempted.</p>

<p class="sidenote">War with
France.</p>

<p>In the year 1740 the state of affairs in Europe seemed to
point to war between England and France. England had
declared war against Spain, and although for a time Lewis
XV. and his ministers sympathized with the latter country,
they endeavoured to avoid being drawn into a
conflict with her powerful neighbour and hereditary
enemy across the Channel. Yet such a
conflict seemed inevitable, when by degrees Spanish commerce
became shattered under the blows of King George's
navy. Apprehensive that England would wrest from Spain
her colonies, France resolved to take sides with Spain. In
1744 war was declared, and hostilities, which had been in
abeyance for thirty-one years, at once recommenced in the
transatlantic possessions of both crowns.</p>

<p>It was therefore decided at a general court of the Adventurers,
at which no fewer than seventy were present, to take
measures to avoid a repetition of the disasters of fifty years
previously. They felt that their enemies were now many,
who would be glad to see them driven from the Bay, and that
less assistance might be expected from the Government than
at any of the crises which had previously overtaken them.
We have seen to what this was due. It now behooved the
Company to gird up its loins, and if the foe came, to strike,
and strike with force.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>It was the Hudson's Bay Company against France and
Spain. The incident of Louisburg alone saved the Company
from destruction.</p>

<p>To illustrate the temper of the Company instructions were
immediately drawn up by the Committee, and despatched
to the chief factors in the Bay. The one addressed to
Joseph Isbister and Council at Albany Fort was dated the
10th of May, 1744.</p>

<p>"The English and French having declared war," it ran,
"against each other, and the war with Spain still continuing,
we do hereby strictly direct you to be always on your guard,
and to keep a good watch, and that you keep all your men as
near home as possible.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bellicose
instructions
from the
Company.</p>

<p>"We do also direct that you fix your cannon in the most
proper places to defend yourselves and annoy an enemy, after
which you are to fire each cannon once with powder to see
how they prove, and instruct your men to the use of them
without firing; and that you keep them constantly loaded
with powder and ball, ready for service. You
are also to keep your small arms loaded and in
good order and at hand, to be easily come at;
and that those loaded arms be drawn or discharged
once a month, and be well cleaned; and
you are to exercise your men once a week till they are well
disciplined and afterwards once a month. And you are also
to keep a sufficient number of your trading guns loaded and
at hand in case of an attack; and if there be any Indians
that you can confide in, and will be of service in your defence,
we recommend it to you to employ them in such manner as
you think proper.</p>

<p>"We have wrote to the factory at Moose River, that in case
they have any intelligence of the French coming down that
river to attack them, they are immediately to send you notice
thereof, that you may make the necessary preparations for
your defence, and that there be a constant correspondence
and intelligence between each factory for the safety of both.</p>

<p>"As we rely on the courage and conduct of Mr. Isbister,
our chief, in case of an attack from the enemy, which, if done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
at all on your factory, we apprehend it will be by land in
the winter, from Canada; in which case the enemy not being
able to bring down any cannon with them, we doubt not of
your frustrating their designs and repulsing them.</p>

<p>"In case you are attacked at Henly House, and notwithstanding
a vigorous resistance you should have the misfortune
to be overpowered, then you are to nail up the cannon, blow
up the House, and destroy everything that can be of service
to the enemy, and make the best retreat you can to the
factory." The letters to the other Governors were in similar
strain.</p>

<p>The Company directed Isbister to get "the best information
you can from the trading Indians, whether the French are
making any preparations to come down to the factory, or
have lodged any provisions, stores or ammunition at certain
distances from their supply. We also direct you, for your
better security, at all times to keep two Indians in the factory
with civil and kind usage, and send them out every morning
for intelligence, to a proper distance, so that they may return
in the evening; and provided that they do not return that it
be an alarm to you, and that you thereupon prepare yourselves
for a vigorous defence. But," it was added, "you
must not, upon any consideration, let those Indians have
the least knowledge of the use you intend to make of their
not returning."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Letters of
marque to the
Company's
ships.</p>

<p>At the Company's urgent request letters of marque were
granted to the <i>Prince Rupert</i> against both France and Spain.
The <i>Prince Rupert</i> was one hundred and eighty tons burthen,
and the crews were full of expectation that the voyage would
yield them a prize of some sort or another. But they were
destined not merely to be disappointed, but to
be given a great fright into the bargain. When
in the neighbourhood of Davis' Straits, where
a whale fishery was established, several large
vessels were sighted. They seemed to the Company's
captain undoubtedly French men-of-war. Filled with
fear, he immediately turned round in his tracks and bore
away as fast as his sails could carry him, and after beating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
about for a time managed to pass through the straits unobserved.
So convinced were the Company on the return of its
ship in the autumn that the French were lying in wait for its
ships at the straits, they sought the Admiralty with a request
for a convoy to York Fort, to return with its vessels the
following autumn.</p>

<p>A convoy was granted, but it was hardly necessary. Louisburg
had fallen, and all the strength the French could muster
was being directed in an attempt to win back that fortress
from the English. No French ships could therefore be spared
to cruise north of latitude fifty in North America.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Confiscation
of Prince
Charlie's
stock.</p>

<p>One consequence of the war with France was a revival of
the hopes of the Jacobites. In 1744 Charles Edward, the
grandson of James II., was placed by Lewis in command of "a
formidable armament," and in the following year the young
Pretender placed his foot on a little island of the Hebrides,
where for three weeks he stood almost alone. But the Highland
blood was fired; the clans rallied to the standard of
"Prince Charlie," and when he began his march on Edinburgh,
several thousand Scottish zealots had rallied to his standard.
"James the Eighth" was proclaimed at the Town Cross of
the capital, and when his troops and the English regiments
met at Preston Pans, in September, the latter were defeated
with heavy loss. But although this victory swelled his numbers
it did not bring the Lowlanders and English to fight for
him. "Hardly a man," we are told, "had risen in his support
as he passed through the districts where Jacobitism boasted
of its strength. The people flocked to see his march as if it
had been a show. Catholics and Tories abounded in Lancashire,
but only a single squire took up arms." The knell of
Jacobitism was rung, and after a brief success the English
forces fell upon Prince Charles Edward at Culloden Moor,
and cut his little army to pieces. Fifty of his followers and
adherents in England ascended the scaffold; Lords Lovat,
Balmerino and Kilmarnock were beheaded, and over forty
noblemen and gentlemen were attainted by Act of Parliament.
Scarcely a month had elapsed from Charles
Edward's escape to France after his romantic adventures,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
when a motion was submitted to the Governor and Company
of Adventurers in England trading into
Hudson's Bay, ordering the confiscation of the
stock held by the heir of the second Governor
of the Company, King James II. The exiled
monarch had never relinquished his share, and
under the name of "John Stanion" the dividends had always
reached him. But the Jacobite rising affected his fellow-adventurers'
complaisance, and by 1746 "John Stanion"
had ceased to figure as an active partner of the Company.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Under date of 3rd of May, 1745, the Company wrote to
Governor Isbister and Council, at Albany Fort, to say that
they had "augmented the complement of men (as you
desired) at your Factory and Moose Fort, that in case of need
you may assist each other, and thereby we hope you will be
enabled to baffle the designs of the enemy.</p>

<p>"We do direct," it pursued, "that not only a continual correspondence
be kept between you and Moose Fort, but that
you correspond with the Factory at Slude River, York Fort,
and Prince of Wales' Fort as often as you can, and if under
any apprehensions of an attack, to give immediate notice to
Moose Fort. We still recommend your diligence in getting
intelligence and information of the designs of the French."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Further
instructions
to Company's
officials.</p>

<p>It also urged Governor Pilgrim and Council, at Prince of
Wales' Fort, "to keep a good watch, and your men near
home, except those that are guarding the battery
at Cape Merry, but not to hinder a proper
number to be employed in providing a sufficient
quantity of the country provisions to prevent
the complaint of those persons that murmur for
want of victuals; and we recommend sobriety, that you may
be capable of making a vigorous defence if attacked.</p>

<p>"We again recommend your keeping the land, round the
Fort and the Battery at Cape Merry, free from everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
that may possibly conceal or shelter an enemy, that you may
thereby prevent being surprised.</p>

<p>"We again direct that you keep up a general correspondence
with all the Factories, and get what intelligence you can of
the designs of the French."</p>

<p>The course of events now bids us return to Dobbs and the
renewed endeavours to find a north-west passage through the
Company's territory.</p>

<p>A number of public-spirited persons came forward for the
prosecution of the design. Parliament was urged to act in
the matter, and a bill was carried, offering a reward of
twenty thousand pounds for the discovery of the north-west
passage.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Parliament
and the
North-West
passage.</p>

<p>"Whereas," ran the Act, "the discovering of a north-west
passage through Hudson's Straits, to the Western American
Ocean, will be of great Benefit and advantage to the trade of
this Kingdom; and whereas it will be a great encouragement
to Adventurers to attempt the same, if a public
reward was given to such person or persons as
shall make a perfect discovery of the said passage:
May it therefore please your Majesty that
it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the
King's Most Excellent Majesty by and with the advice and
consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons
in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of
the same, that if any ship or vessel, ships or vessels belonging
to any of his Majesty's subjects, shall find out and sail through
any passage by sea between Hudson's Bay and the Western
and Southern Ocean of America, the owner or owners of such
ship or ships, vessel or vessels as aforesaid, so first finding out
and sailing through the said passage, his or their executors,
administrators or assigns shall be entitled to receive and shall
receive as a reward for such discovery, the sum of twenty
thousand pounds."</p>

<p>Parliament took care, however, to declare that nothing in
the Act should "in any ways extend or be construed to take
away or prejudice any of the estates, rights or privileges of or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
belonging to the Governor and Company of Adventurers
trading into Hudson's Bay."</p>

<p>With such encouragement, it was not long before a North-West
Association was formed for the raising of £10,000,
which sum it was thought would answer the necessary expense
of the proposed expedition. The ships bought by the Committee
were one of one hundred and eighty tons, called the
<i>Dobbs' Galley</i>, and another of one hundred and forty tons, to
which the name of the <i>California</i> was given. Each of these
vessels was got ready, and a sufficient quantity of stores and
provisions put on board. A cargo of merchandise, suitable
for presents to the natives was put on board, after assurance
to the Hudson's Bay Company that these would not be used
for purpose of barter. The command of the <i>Dobbs' Galley</i>
was entrusted to Captain William Moor, an old servant of the
Company; that of the <i>California</i> being given to Francis
Smith. By way of encouragement, premiums were settled on
officers and crew, in case of success. Thus the captain was
to have £500, each of the mates £200, and every other officer
and seaman a reward suitable to his station. Over and
above all this, in case they were so fortunate as to take any
prizes, such were to belong entirely to them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Expedition
of the
North-West
Association.</p>

<p>On the 10th of May the expedition started. In order that
they might get safely beyond the British Isles
without danger from the French privateersmen,
the Admiralty appointed a convoy to meet
them at the Island of Pomona, in the Orkneys.
Judge of their surprise to find this convoy
commanded by Captain Middleton himself, on board
the <i>Shark</i>. Some days later the explorer of 1742 and the
explorers of 1746 bade farewell to one another.</p>

<p>For some months the ships cruised about the Bay. At last,
in September, it was decided to set about preparations for
wintering in some part of Hays' River. This they found in a
creek about five miles above York Factory, on the south side
of the stream. The locality was, perhaps, hardly congenial in
a social sense.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Governor
Norton.</p>

<p>"The Governor," says one who accompanied the expedition
as the agent of the patrons,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> "being now convinced of our
intentions to winter there, used his utmost endeavours that
we might lay our ships below the fort, in a place open to the
sea, where they would have been in all probability beat to
pieces, either from the waves of the sea setting
in or the breaking of the ice; but as his arguments
were of no efficacy in persuading us, and
finding himself disappointed in this, as in his former scheme,
being still resolved to distress us as much as possible, he
sent most of the Indians, whose chief employment is to kill
deer, geese, etc., into the country, on purpose that we
might not make use of them in that way, or be in any wise
benefited by their means."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0281" id="im_0281"></a>
<img src="images/im_0281.jpg" width="401" height="343" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Contemporary Map Showing the Hays' River.</span></p>
<a href="images/im_0281-l.jpg">View larger image</a>
</div>

<p>The charge that Governor Norton desired the destruction
of the ships is too absurd to refute at this late day; nevertheless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
there is little doubt that the explorers believed it, and
anything else their inflamed imaginations and prejudices
against the Company suggested. Even when Norton designed
to show them kindness, the design was twisted into
one of sinister shape. For instance, hearing that their supply
of liquor was short, when Christmas came around, he sent as
a present to the explorers, at the little log-house they had
christened Montague House, a couple of casks of brandy with
which to make good cheer. Soon afterwards scurvy broke
out, and the disease was set down immediately to the brandy.
"Our people had been healthy enough before," says Ellis.</p>

<p>But even when the scurvy had carried off several of the
men at Montague House, Governor Norton was alleged to
have refused both to succour or to suggest a remedy. "The
Indians were charged not to come near us, or to furnish us
with anything (and this out of consideration for them), because
we had a contagious distemper amongst us." Norton's
sole view in all his actions is represented to have been to
hinder and distress the explorers, "which," remarks the writer
quoted, philosophically, "is the encouragement that all are to
expect who go in search of a north-west passage <i>from such
neighbours</i>."</p>

<p>When spring came the expedition resumed its labours. It
is said the crews were full of alacrity and cheerfulness. One
honest seaman, "whose sole delight was a delicious dram,"
was so enthusiastic over the discovery that "in the warm sincerity
of his heart he could not help saying, with a good,
round oath, 'Now, I had rather find the north-west passage
than half an anchor of brandy!'"</p>

<p class="sidenote">Return of the
expedition
to England.</p>

<p>The summer was spent in coasting the whole north-west
side of the Bay. But, alas, the north-west passage
so ardently and characteristically desired by the "honest
sea-man," was not found, and by the 14th of October the
expedition was back again in England, after an
absence of one year four months and seventeen
days. The explorers and the patrons might
well have been discouraged from further attempts,
albeit they returned, we are told, "with clearer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
and fuller proofs, founded on plain facts and accurate
experiments, that such a passage existed." Nevertheless, if
the Company breathed easier on their return, it was a temporary
relief. A new trial was in store for the Honourable
Adventurers.</p>

<p>In 1748, war still continuing with France and Spain, the
Company again issued strict orders to Governor Spence at
Albany Fort to be always on his guard, and "to keep a good
watch and your men near home, but not to hinder a proper
number to be employed in providing a sufficient quantity of
the country provisions, particularly geese, which we find you
constantly employ the Indians only to kill for you, and which
we are dissatisfied with; that being such a material article,
you ought always to blend some of your people with the
natives in the goose seasons, that they may understand how
to kill them, and thereby lessen your dependence on the
native hunters."</p>

<p>To the Governor of Prince of Wales' Fort it directed that
he should "constantly keep his great guns loaded with
powder and ball ready for service during the time the rivers
are open. You are also to keep your small arms loaded and
in good order, and at hand, to be easily come at, which loaded
arms and cannon are to be drawn once a month and well
cleaned, and to exercise your men as often as requisite, whom
we expect by this time are artists, not only in the use of
small arms but also of cannon, that the great expense we
have been at in this particular may answer the end proposed
thereby in case of an attack. You are also to keep a sufficient
number of your trading guns loaded and at hand,
which charges are also to be drawn every month, and if there
be any Indians you can confide in, and will be of service to
you in your defence, we recommend it to you to employ them
in such manner as you think proper."</p>

<p>Certainly if a French commander of even Iberville's
power had appeared before the forts of the Company in 1748
he would have met with a far different reception to that
which was offered to that champion in 1697.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<p>The Company suffered much from the press-gangs, from
time to time, and in eras of war the evil was almost intolerable.
It was well-known that the sailors in its employ were
amongst the ablest and hardiest on the high seas, which fact
exposed them perpetually to the onslaughts of the crimps
and bullies.</p>

<p>In 1739 the Company's vessel, the <i>Seahorse</i>, was intercepted
by the man-of-war <i>Warwick</i>, and seventeen men of
the <i>Seahorse</i> crew captured by the press-gang for services in
the navy.</p>

<p>That the <i>Seahorse</i> might not be totally without servants, a
number of incompetent landsmen were put aboard in their
stead. Nevertheless, the voyage was continued to the Bay,
although not without great peril, not arriving until 27th of
September. The voyage of the disabled <i>Seahorse</i> was long a
tradition in the Company's service.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Dobb's petition
rejected
by a Parliamentary
committee.</p>

<p>By an Order-in-Council dated the 4th of February, 1748,
a petition from Arthur Dobbs and members of a committee
appointed by the subscribers for finding out a
passage to the Western and Southern Ocean of
America, "was referred to the consideration of a
committee of Parliament." After hearing counsel
for and against the Company, this committee of
two members decided that "considering how long the Company
have enjoyed and acted under this charter without interruption
or encroachment, we cannot think it advisable for his
Majesty to make any express or implied declaration against
the validity of it till there has been some judgment of a
court of justice to warrant it." Dobbs and his friends were
enraged at this decision, and lost no time in taking other
steps.

</p>

<p class="sidenote">Parliamentary
enquiry.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sharpe, the Company's solicitor," we read in the
Company's minute-books, under date of March 10th, 1748,
"attending the Committee acquainted them that a motion
was yesterday made and carried in the House
of Commons to enquire into the state and condition
of the countries and trade of Hudson's
Bay, and also the right the Company pretend to have by
charter to the property of the land, and exclusive trade to
those countries, and that a committee was appointed
accordingly."</p>

<p>The Adventurers were not caught entirely unawares. They
had expected some such move on the part of their opponents,
and now determined that since they could not ward off the enquiry,
they would take the best means to present the most
favourable statement of the Company's case to the nation.
A ransacking of books and records ensued; and a rigorous
search after facts bearing on the beneficent character of the
Company's rule and policy; and these proofs being at length
ready, were placed by the following December in the form of
a memorial in the hands of every member of the House of
Commons.</p>

<p>The enquiry aroused the greatest national interest. It
began soon after Christmas, 1748, and lasted for two months.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Plea of the
malcontents.</p>

<p>What the malcontents desired is, perhaps, best explained in
the words of their prime mover: "By opening," said he,
"the trade in the Bay, many thousands more would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
employed in trade, and a much greater vent would be opened
for our manufactures. Whereas all the gain we have at present,
whilst the trade is confined to the Company, is the
employment of one hundred and twenty men in all their
factories, and two or three ships in that trade, manned with
perhaps one hundred and twenty men in time of war, to
enrich nine or ten<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> merchants at their country's expense;
at the same time betraying the nation, by allowing the
French to encroach upon us at the bottom of the Bay, having
given up by that means the greatest part of their trade there
to the French. It is, therefore, humbly submitted to the
Government, whether it is not just, as well as prudent, to open
that trade to all the British merchants, and resume at the
same time the charter, so far as to take from them all those
lands they have not reclaimed or occupied after seventy
years possession, leaving them only their factories, and such
lands as they have reclaimed adjoining to them; and to give
grants as usual in other colonies to all who shall go over to
trade and make settlements in the country; for
no grants were ever intended to be made to
them, to enable them to prevent other subjects
of Britain from planting colonies in those countries, which
they themselves would not plant or occupy; for such a
power, instead of being beneficial, would be the greatest
prejudice to Britain, and is become a general law in
the colonies, that those who take grants of land and don't
plant them in a reasonable, limited time, forfeit their rights to
those lands, and a new grant is made out to such others as
shall plant and improve them; and if this grant be not
immediately resumed so far and the trade laid open, and
some force be not sent to secure our southern possessions in
the Bay by the Government in case there should be a French
war, we shall see the French immediately dispossess the
Company of all their factories but Churchill, and all these
countries and that trade will be in the possession of the
French." So ran the argument of the Company's enemies.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<p>On the 24th of April, 1749, Lord Strange presented, on
behalf of the Select Committee, the report to Parliament.</p>

<p>"The Committee," said he, "appointed to enquire into the
state and condition of the countries adjoining to Hudson's
Bay and the trade carried on there; and to consider how
those countries may be settled and improved, and the trade
and fisheries there extended and increased; and also to
enquire into the right the Company of Adventurers trading
into Hudson's Bay pretend to have, by charter, to the
property of lands and exclusive trade to those countries;
have pursuant to the order of the House, examined into the
several matters to them referred.</p>

<p>"Your Committee thought proper, in the first place, to
enquire into the nature and extent of the charter granted by
King Charles the Second, to the Company of Adventurers
trading into Hudson's Bay; under which charter the present
Company claim as right to lands and an exclusive trade to
those countries; which charter being laid before your Committee,
they thought it necessary for the information of the
House to annex a copy thereof to this report."</p>

<p>The charter, published now for the first time, was deemed to
be valid.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Witnesses
called by the
committee.</p>

<p>The Committee had examined the witnesses in the case.
These witnesses were: Joseph Robson, who had been
employed in the Bay for six years as a stonemason; Richard
White, who had been a clerk at Albany Fort and elsewhere;
Matthew Sargeant, who had been employed in the Company's
service and "understood the Indian language"; John Hayter,
who had been house carpenter to the Company
for six years at Moose River; Matthew Gwynne,
who had been twice at Hudson's Bay; Edward
Thompson, who had been three years at Moose
River as surgeon; Enoch Alsop, who had been armourer
to the Company at Moose River; Christopher Bannister, who
had been armourer and gunsmith, and had resided in the
Bay for twenty-two years; Robert Griffin, silversmith, who
had been five years in the Company's service; Thomas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
Barnet Smith, who went over to Albany in 1741; Alexander
Brown, who had been six years at Hudson's Bay as surgeon;
Captain Thomas Mitchell, who had commanded a sloop of
the Company.</p>

<p>Besides the above witnesses there was, of course, Dobbs
himself, who was "examined as to the information he had
received from a French-Canadese Indian (since deceased) who
was maintained at the expense of the Admiralty, on the
prospect of his being of service on the discovery of a north-west
passage." Dobbs "informed your Committee that the
whole of that discourse is contained in part of a book printed
for the witness in 1744, to which he desired leave to refer."<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
There also appeared Captain William Moor, who had been
employed in Hudson's Bay from a boy; Henry Spurling,
merchant, who had traded in furs for twenty-eight years past,
during which time he had dealt with the Hudson's Bay Company;
Captain Carruthers, who had been in the Company's
service thirty-five years ago; and Arthur Slater, who had
been employed by the Company on the East Main.</p>

<p>The opposition endeavoured to show that one object aimed
at in granting a charter to the Hudson's Bay Company was to
further the discovery of the north-west passage. This of
course was absurd. It was charged that they had done almost
nothing in this direction, which the Adventurers on their
part rebutted by furnishing Parliament with a list of the ships
they had fitted out for such a discovery.</p>

<p>In the evidence before the Committee, it became clear that
the witnesses were not unanimous, especially concerning the
probability of finding a north-west passage.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Evidence as to
a north-west
passage.</p>

<p>The evidence of Edward Thompson, the ship surgeon on the
<i>Furnace</i>, for example, states that he has the "greatest reason
to believe there is one, from the winds, tides and black whales;
and he thinks the place to be at Chesterfield Inlet; that the
reason of their coming back was they met the other boat
which had been five leagues farther, and the crew told them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
the water was much fresher and shallower there, but where he
was the water was fifty fathoms deep, and the tide very
strong; the ebb six hours and the flood two, to the best of
his remembrance; that it is not common for the
tide to flow only two hours." He imagined it
to be obstructed by another tide from the westward.
The rapidity of the tide upwards was so
great that the spray of the water flew over the bow of the
schooner, and was "so salt that it candied on the men's shoes,
but the tide did not run in so rapid a manner the other way."
Captain William Moor, being asked if he believed there was a
north-west passage to the South Seas, said he believed there
was a communication, but "whether navigable or not he
cannot say; that if there is any such communication, 'tis
farther northward than he expected; that if it is but short, as
'tis but probable to conclude from the height of the tides, 'tis
possible it might be navigable. It was the opinion of all the
persons sent on that discovery that a north-west wind made
the highest tides." According to Captain Carruthers, "he
don't apprehend there is any such passage; but if there is, he
thinks it impracticable to navigate it on account of the ice;
that he would rather choose to go round by Cape Horn; and
that it will be impossible to go and return through such
passage in one year; and he thinks 'tis the general opinion of
seamen, that there is no such passage." In which opinion the
seamen were in the right, although Dobbs and his friends
were long to hold the contrary.</p>

<p>John Tomlinson, a London merchant, testified that he was
a subscriber to "the undertaking for finding a north-west
passage, which undertaking was dropped for want of money;
that he should not choose to subscribe again on the same
terms; that he can not pretend to say whether there is
such a passage or not, or whether, if found, it could ever be
rendered useful to navigation."</p>

<p>It was only to be expected that the merchants, having no
share in the Company's profits, should be, to a man, in favour
of throwing open the trade of Hudson's Bay. Tomlinson, for
example, gave it out as his opinion that if the charter were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
revoked more ships would be sent and more Indians brought
down to trade. "This is confirmed," said he, "by the experience
of the Guinea trade, which, when confined to a company,
employed not above ten ships, and now employs one hundred
and fifty." He moreover asserted that "the case of the
Guinea trade was exactly similar, where the ships are near
one another, and each endeavours to get the trade; and the
more ships lie there the higher the prices of negroes."</p>

<p class="sidenote">The
Company's
profits.</p>

<p>The Company was obliged, in the course of this enquiry, to
divulge a number of facts relating to its trade, which had
until then remained secret. Parliament was informed that
the trade between London and Hudson's Bay was carried on
in 1748, and for some years previous, by means of four ships;
that the cost of the exports was in that year
£5,012 12s. 3d.; that the value of the sales of furs
and other imports amounted to £30,160 5s. 11d.
As for the "charge attending the carrying on
of the Hudson's Bay trade, and maintaining their factories,"
it was, in 1748, £17,352 4s. 10d. Thus a trade which involved
only £5,000 a year in exports brought back a return
of £30,000. Even when the outlay for working and maintenance
of forts and establishments was considered, there
was, in dull times, a profit of forty per cent on actual paid-up
capital.</p>

<p>With regard to French competition, many of the witnesses
were most emphatic. Robson, for instance, "thought that the
beavers which are brought down to the Company are refused
by the French from their being a heavy commodity; for the
natives who come to trade with the Company dispose of their
small, valuable furs to the French, and bring down their heavy
goods to the Company in summer when the rivers are open,
which they sell, and supply the French with European goods
purchased from the Company."</p>

<p>"The French," said Richard White, another witness, "intercept
the Indians coming down with their trade," he having
seen them with guns and clothing of French manufacture;
and further an Indian had told him that there was a French
settlement up Moose River, something to the southward of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
west, at the distance, as the witness apprehended, of about
fifty miles. "The French deal in light furs, and take all of
that sort they can get, and the Indians bring the heavy to us.
Sometimes the Indians bring down martens' skins, but that
is when they don't meet with the French; but never knew
any Indians who had met the French bring down light furs.
The French settlement on Moose River is at Abbitibi Lake.
The trade," concluded the witness, "might be further extended
by sending up Europeans to winter amongst the natives, which,
though the Company have not lately attempted, the French
actually do."</p>

<p>"The French," said another, "intercept the trade; to prevent
which the Company some time ago built Henley House,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
which did, in some measure, answer the purpose: but if they
would build farther in the country it would have a better
effect. The French went there first, and are better beloved;
but if we would go up into the country the French Indians
would trade with us."</p>

<p class="sidenote">French
encroachment
on trade.</p>

<p>Another of the witnesses testified that he "has been
informed by the Indians that the French-Canadese Indians
come within six score miles of the English factories. The
French Indians come to Albany to trade for their heavy
goods." He said he had heard Governor Norton say that the
"French ran away with our trade." "If," continued this
witness, Alexander Brown, "the trade was opened, the French
would not intercept the Indians, since in that
case the separate traders must have out-factories
in the same manner the French have, which the
Company have not." Upon being asked by
Lord Strange if "in case those out-settlements were erected,
whether the same trade could be carried on at the present
settlements?" the witness replied that "it would be impossible,
but that the trade would be extended, and by that
means they would take it from the French. That if these
settlements were near the French, they must have garrisons
to secure them against the French, and the Indians who trade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
with and are in friendship with them (whom he distinguished
by the name of French Indians)."</p>

<p>Brown quoted Norton as saying, in the year 1739, "that the
French had a settlement at about the distance of one hundred
or six score miles from Churchill, which had been built about
a year, and contained sixty men with small arms."</p>

<p>The result of the deliberations of the Committee of Enquiry
was, on the whole, favourable to the Company. The charter
was pronounced unassailable, and the Company had made out
a good case against its enemies. It had certainly permitted
the encroachments of the French. But the English Government
of the day foresaw that French possession of Canada
was doomed, and the Company could make ample amends
when the British flag was unfurled at Quebec and at Montreal.</p>

<p>The Company having come out of the ordeal unharmed,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
the Lords of Trade and Plantations thought it might as well
settle in its own mind the precise territory claimed by the
Company under its charter. The Company, on its part, was
not forgetful that the French Government had not yet paid
its little bill, which having been running for over sixty years,
had now assumed comparatively gigantic proportions.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The
Government
asks the
Company to
define its
territory.</p>

<p>Accordingly the Lords of Trade and Plantations, on the
25th of July, 1750, addressed a letter to the Company, representing
that "as it was for the benefit of the plantations that
the limits or boundaries of the British Colonies on the Continent
of America should be distinctly known, more particularly
as they border on the settlements made by the French, or any
foreign nation in America, their Lordships desired as exact
an account as possible of the limits and boundaries
of the territory granted to the Company,
together with a chart or map thereof, and all
the best accounts and vouchers they can obtain
to support the same, and particularly, if any, or
what settlements have been made by the English
on the frontiers towards the lakes, and if any, or what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
encroachments have been made, and at what period, and
to be exact in stating every particular in the history of whatever
encroachments have been made, which may serve to
place the proceedings in a true light, and confute any right
which may at any time be founded upon them."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Company's
reply.</p>

<p>The Company replied, among other things, that the said
Straits and Bays "are now so well known, that it is apprehended
they stand in no need of any particular description
than by the chart or map herewith delivered; and the limits
or boundaries of the lands and countries lying round the
same, comprised, as your memorialists conceive, in the same
grant, are as follows, that is to say: all the lands lying on the
east side or coast of the said Bay, and extending from the
Bay eastward to the Atlantic Ocean and Davis' Strait, and
the line hereafter mentioned as the east and south-eastern
boundaries of the said Company's territories; and towards
the north, all the lands that lie at the north end, or on the
north side or coast of the said Bay, and extending from the
Bay northwards to the utmost limits of the lands; then
towards the North Pole; but where or how these lands terminate
is hitherto unknown. And towards the
west, all the lands that lie on the west side or
coast of the said Bay, and extending from the
said Bay westward to the utmost limits of those lands; but
where or how these lands terminate to the westward is also
unknown, though probably it will be found they terminate
on the Great South Sea, and towards the south," they propose
the line already set out by them, before and soon after the
Treaty of Utrecht, stating that the Commissioners under that
treaty were never able to bring the settlement of the said
limits to a final conclusion; but they urged that the limits
of the territories granted to them, and of the places appertaining
to the French, should be settled upon the footing
above mentioned.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Utrecht stipulated that the French King
should restore to Great Britain in full right forever, Hudson's
Bay, the Straits, and all lands, rivers, coasts, etc., there situate.
Further, that the Hudson's Bay Company be repaid their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
losses by French hostile incursions and depredations in time
of peace.</p>

<p>The Hudson's Bay Company now went farther and asked
the Government to insist that no French vessel should be
allowed to pass to the north or north-west of a line drawn
from Grimington's Island and Cape Perdrix.</p>

<p>One of the most feasible plans of the Company's foes
seemed to be to get hold of some adjacent territory, and
from that vantage ground gradually encroach on the chartered
preserves. Such seems to have been the scheme in July, 1752,
when a petition was presented to the Lords of Trade and
Plantations, from "several London Merchants," who sought a
grant of "all that part of America lying on the Atlantic Ocean
on the east part, extending south and north from 52° north
latitude from the equinoctial line to 60° of the same north
latitude, called Labradore or New Britain, not at this time
possessed by any of his Majesty's subjects or the subjects of
any Christian prince or state."</p>

<p>On the receipt of this petition by the Government, the
Hudson's Bay Company was called upon to say whether it
laid claim to this tract. In their reply the Honourable
Adventurers referred to the grant of Charles II. of all rights
to trade and commerce of those seas, etc., within entrance of
Hudson's Straits, and of all lands on the coasts and confines
thereof; Labrador throughout its whole extent, from 60° north
latitude to 52°, was therefore alleged to be within their limits.</p>

<p>The Company was already settled there, and had spent
£10,000 on it. Moreover, declared the Company, it was a
barren land, with few beavers or other furs of value.</p>

<p>The Company suggested that the "London Merchants'"
aim was to gain a footing and draw off the Hudson's Bay
Company's trade, which it hoped would not be permitted.
This hope of the Adventurers was realized, for the petition of
the London Merchants was not allowed.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<p>France's fatal hour with respect to her sovereignty over
Canada rapidly approached. In December, 1759, the Company
wrote as follows to the Lords of Plantations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In prospect of an approaching Treaty of Peace between this nation
and France, and in the hope that the great success his Majesty's arms
have been blessed with, and the many acquisitions that have been thereby
gained from the enemy, will enable his Majesty to secure to your
memorialists satisfaction for the injuries and depredations they have
long since suffered from the French, which stands acknowledged by
treaty and are stipulated to be made satisfaction for, but through the
perfidy of the enemy, and in disregard of the treaty have hitherto
remained unsatisfy'd; in which the honour of the nation as well as
justice to the individuals, loudly call for redress.
</p>
</div>

<p>Halifax and Soame Jenyns thereupon wrote to Pitt in
these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Sir,&mdash;The Governor and Company of Merchants trading to Hudson's
Bay having presented a memorial to us, stating their claims with respect
to limits and other matters provided for by the Treaty of Utrecht, and
praying that in case of a peace with France, his Majesty would be
graciously pleased to cause satisfaction to be made to them with respect
to such claims, pursuant to the stipulations of the tenth and eleventh
articles of the said treaty; we beg leave to transmit to you the enclosed
copy of the said memorial for his Majesty's directions thereupon.
</p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">Conquest of
Canada.</p>

<p>While England went mad with joy over Wolfe's victory at
Quebec, the Company thought the time had, at last, come
when the indemnity it claimed so long should be exacted in
the treaty of peace which could not be long
delayed. But its sanguine expectations were
not destined to be realized. In vain did the
Governor wait at the door of Mr. Secretary Pitts; in vain
did Lord Halifax assure the Company's secretary that he
would make it his own personal business to have the affair
attended to. It was too late in the day.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> With reason might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
the Company's zealous secretary trace in the minutes:
"Locked up this day (November 22nd, 1759), in the Great
Iron Chest, a Book containing estimates of the Company's
losses sustained from the French, from 1682 to 1688."</p>

<p>The "Great Iron Chest" was to hold the book for many a
day, and though the Company evinced a never-failing alacrity
to produce it, yet never was there to be inscribed the words
"settled with thanks," at the foot of this "little bill against
the French."</p>

<p>We have already been made familiar with the character of
the Company's forts in the Bay so late as the reign of Queen
Anne. There had been almost from the beginning a party
amongst the Honourable Adventurers favourable to the erection
of strong forts, not built of logs with bastions of stone,
but of stone throughout, from the designs of competent
engineers.</p>

<p>A few years after the Company had regained possession of
York Factory, it built (1718) a wooden fort at Churchill
River, to which was given the name of Prince of Wales. In
1730 it constructed another at Moose River; and about
the same time a small post, capable of containing eight or ten
men at Slude River, on the East Main. In 1720 Henley
House, one hundred and fifty miles up Albany River, was
built to contain a garrison of eight men, as a check to the
Indians who carried on a trade with the French.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Building of
stone forts.</p>

<p>But the wooden fort Prince of Wales did not remain long.
The remembrance of their former posts destroyed by fire,
and Iberville's cannon, caused the Company
at length to undertake the fortification on a
splendid scale of its best harbour, to safeguard
what it designed to be its principal <i>entrepôt</i>
from the French, as well as from the Indians. Opposition
was cried down, and the "fortification party," as it was called,
carried the day. A massive thirty-feet wide foundation was
begun at Churchill, from the plans of military engineers who
had served under Marlborough, and, after many vicissitudes,
in 1734 Fort Prince of Wales, one of the strongest forts on
the continent, was reared at the mouth of Churchill River.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0297" id="im_0297"></a>
<img src="images/im_0297.jpg" width="550" height="306" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fort Prince of Wales.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It was the original intention to have the walls forty-two
feet thick at their foundation, but on account of the Governor's
interference the dimensions were reduced to twenty-five.
It was afterwards found, however, that there was a tendency
to sink when cannon were fired frequently from the walls, so
one section was forthwith pulled down and rebuilt according
to original plans. Three of the bastions had arches for storehouses,
forty feet three inches by ten feet, and in the fourth
was built a stone magazine twenty-four feet long and ten feet
wide in the clear, with a passage to it through the gorge of
the bastion twenty-four feet long and four feet wide.</p>

<p>The parapets were originally constructed of wood, supplied
by denuding the old fort, situated five miles up the Churchill
River, the site of which was first occupied in 1688; but in
1746 the Company began erecting a stone parapet. Robson's
plan shows that two houses, a dwelling and office building,
were erected inside the fort, and incidentally he describes one
of the two as being one hundred and eighty-one feet six inches
by thirty-three feet, with side walls seventeen feet high and
the roof covered with lead.</p>

<p>In 1730 Moose, a new fort, was erected on the site of
Moose Factory. About the same time Richmond Fort was
built on Whale River, but it did not continue a great many
years. I find, under date of 21st December, 1758, that "the
Governor represented to the Committee that Richmond Fort
did not give a sufficient return to pay the most moderate
charge of supporting it," and it was "resolved that the Company's
servants and effects be withdrawn from there as soon
as conveniently may be and replaced at such of the Company's
other factories as shall be found needful." Further, it was
"resolved that a factory with accommodation for twelve
men, with all convenience for trading goods stores, and provisions,
be built as early as possible in the year 1760, in
the most convenient place for that purpose on the north side
of Severn River and as high up as may be."</p>

<p>At the same time it was ordered that the number of men
for York Fort and the new settlement to be made on the
Severn River should be forty-eight men.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Clandestine
trade.</p>

<p>Clandestine trade was a constantly recurring feature of
eighteenth century life in the Bay. Charges were repeatedly
preferred against the Company's servants, and
altogether scores were dismissed as a punishment
for this offence. It must be confessed
that there was often a temptation difficult to
resist. Nothing seemed more natural for the poor apprentice
to trade his jack-knife, Jew's-harp or silk kerchief with an
Indian or Esquimau for a peltry; and the only reason,
perhaps, why private bartering was not indulged in more
generally was the certainty of detection. But with the
Governors and traders and ship captains, risk was reduced
to a minimum.</p>

<p>One of the most unfortunate examples was the case of
Captain Coats. This able mariner had been in the employ
of the Company for a period of many years. None was
superior to him in knowledge of the Bay and straits.
Captain Coats had been twice shipwrecked, once in 1727,
"when near the meridian of Cape Farewell, when running
through the ice with a small sail, when two pieces of ice shutt
upon us and sank our ship"; and again in 1736, when he was
entangled in the ice off Cape Resolution, when his ship had
her sides crushed in and sank in twenty minutes. Coats drew
up a journal for the use of his sons, containing an elaborate
description of the Bay and its approaches, together with a
great deal of relative matter; and this journal, which has
received the honour of publication by the Hakluyt Society,
concludes by saying that if these sons are neglected by the
Hudson's Bay Company they are at liberty, and "it is his will
and command that every part be made publick, for the use and
benefit of mankind."</p>

<p>There is herein, it is almost needless to say, no mention of
the captain's clandestine trading operations, which extended
over a long series of years, and which might never have been
made known to the Company had it not been for the sudden
death of Pilgrim, who was formerly governor at Prince of
Wales and Moose Fort. A number of private letters and
papers reached England, incriminating Coats, but they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
never reached the public; nor in 1752, were the Hakluyt
Society cognisant of the fate which overtook their author.
"Of the writer," remarks Sir John Barrow, who edited the
volume, "the editor can learn but little; nothing, in fact, is
now known of Captain Coats, except that he was in the
Company's service as commander of one or other of their
ships from 1727 to 1751." He added that the memorial was
believed to exist in the Company's archives.</p>

<p>Under date of November 28th, 1751, I find the following:
"The Governor having acquainted the Committee of this
affair, and laid the letters and papers before them, they were
fully examined and the contents thereof considered." Coats
was then called in and told of the information they had
received, and the cause they had to suspect that he had
defrauded the Company by carrying on a clandestine trade
greatly to their prejudice and contrary to the fidelity he
owed the Company.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Case of
Capt. Coats.</p>

<p>Coats at first endeavoured to excuse himself, but finding
the proofs contained in the letter papers (many of which
were in his own handwriting and signature) so strong in
evidence against him, at last owned he was
guilty of the offence he was accused of and
submitted himself to the Company, and he was
ordered to withdraw while his case was considered.
At the expiration of two hours the culprit was
called in and acquainted with his sentence, which was dismissal
from the service. He was ordered to deliver up the
keys of the <i>King George</i>, of which he was commander,
together with the stores and the keys of such stores in the
warehouse in his custody belonging to the Company.</p>

<p>The disgraced captain went home, and after a miserable
existence of some weeks, ended his life by his own hand.
On the 20th of February, there is a letter to the Company
from his widow, Mary Coats, which was read out to the
Adventurers assembled. It prayed that the Committee
would "indulge her so far as to order the balance that shall
appear upon her late husband's account to be paid, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
permit her to have the stores brought home, still remaining in
the <i>King George</i>; the profit of these, urged the widow, had
always been enjoyed by every master in the Company's
services." Moved by the appeal, Widow Coats was called
in and informed that provided she delivered up to the Company
all the books, papers, charts or drafts belonging to her late
husband and now in her custody, she might expect to meet
with the favour of the Company. "For which she returned
thanks and promised to comply therewith." But the Hakluyt
Society's publication of Coats' journal is sufficient to show
that his widow did not keep to the strict letter of her word.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Effect of the
Conquest.</p>

<p>The conquest of Canada by the English in 1760<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> had an
almost instantaneous effect upon the fur-trade of the French.
The system of licenses was swept away with the <i>régime</i> of
Intendants of New France. The posts which, established
chiefly for purposes of trade, were yet military, came to be
abandoned, and the officers who directed them turned their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
disconsolate faces towards France, or to other lands where the
flag of the lily still waved. The English colonies were not
devoid of diligent traders ready to pursue their
calling advantageously: but they shrank from
penetrating a country where the enemy might
yet lurk, a country of whose approaches, and of
whose aspect or inhabitants they knew nothing and feared
everything. As for the Indians themselves, they, for a time,
awaited patiently the advent of the French trader. Spring
came and found them at the deserted posts. They sought
but they could not find; "their braves called loudly, but the
sighing trees alone answered their call." Despair at first
filled the bosoms of the Red men when they found that all
their winter's toil and hardships in the forest and over the
trail had been in vain. They waited all summer, and then,
as the white trader came not, wearily they took up their
burdens and began their journey anew.</p>

<p>For a wise Indian had appeared amongst them, and he had
said: "Fools, why do you trust these white traders who come
amongst you with beads, and fire-water and crucifixes? They
are but as the crows that come and are gone. But there are
traders on the banks of the great lake yonder who are never
absent, neither in our time nor in the time of our grandfathers
and great-grandfathers. They are like the rock which cannot
be moved, and they give good goods and plenty, and always
the same. If you are wise you will go hence and deal with
them, and never trust more the traders who are like fleas and
grasshoppers&mdash;here one minute and flown away the next."</p>

<p>More than one factor of the Company heard and told of
this oft-spoken harangue, and many there lived to testify to
its effect upon the assembled Indians. Not even was it forgotten
or disregarded years afterwards in the height of the
prosperity of the Northmen, whose arts of suasion were
exercised in vain to induce the Red man to forego his journey
to York, Churchill or Cumberland.</p>

<p>"No," they would say, "we trade with our friends, as our
grandfathers did. Our fathers once waited for the French
and Bostonians to come to their forts, and they lay down and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
died, and their squaws devoured them, waiting still. You are
here to-day, but will you be here to-morrow? No, we are
going to trade with the Company."</p>

<p>And so they pressed on, resisting temptation, wayward,
though loyal, enduring a long and rough journey that they
might deal with their friends.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The "coureurs
de bois."</p>

<p>Thus for some years the Company prospered, and did a
more thriving business than ever. But before, however, dealing
with the new <i>régime</i>, let us turn for a moment to the
Canadian bushrangers and voyageurs thus cut off
from their homes and abandoned by their officers
and employers. Their occupation was gone&mdash;whither
did they drift? Too long had they led
the untrammelled life of the wilderness to adjust again the
fetters of a civilized life in Montreal or Quebec; they were
attached to their brave and careless masters; these in many
instances they were permitted to follow; but large numbers
dispersed themselves amongst the Indians. Without capital
they could no longer follow the fur-trade; they were fond of
hunting and fishing; and so by allying themselves with Indian
wives, and by following the pursuits and adopting the customs
of the Red men, themselves became virtually savages,
completely severed from their white fellows.</p>

<p>But an influx of Scotch Highlanders had been taking place
in Canada ever since 1745, and some of these bold spirits
were quick to see the advantages of prosecuting, without legal
penalty, a private trade in furs. To these were added English
soldiers, who were discharged at the peace, or had previously
deserted. How many of these were slain by the aborigines,
and never more heard of, can never be computed; but it is
certain that many more embarked in the fur-trade and fell
victims to the tomahawk, torch, hunger and disease than there
is any record of.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Hostility of
the Indians to
the English.</p>

<p>It is certain, also, that the hostility of the tribes, chief
amongst them the Iroquois, to the English,
was very great, and this hostility was nourished
for some years by the discontented bushrangers
and voyageurs. In the action of Pontiac at
Detroit, and the surprise and capture of Michilimackinac
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
with its attendant horrors, there is ample proof, both of
the spirit animating the Indians, and the danger which went
hand in hand with the new trade in furs.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0305" id="im_0305"></a>
<img src="images/im_0305.jpg" width="343" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Blackfoot Brave.</span><br />
(<i>Drawn by Edmund Morris, after photo.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The first of these English traders at Michilimackinac to
penetrate into the west, where the French had gone, is said to
be Thomas Curry. This man, having by shrewdness and
ability procured sufficient capital for the purpose, engaged
guides and interpreters, purchased a stock of goods and provisions,
and with four canoes reached Fort Bourbon, which
was situated at the western extremity of Cedar Lake, on
the waters of the Saskatchewan. His venture was successful,
and he returned to Montreal with his canoes loaded with fine
furs. But he never expressed a desire to repeat the performance,
although it was not long before his example was
followed by many others. James Finlay was the first of
these; he penetrated to Nipawee, the last of the French
posts on the Saskatchewan, in latitude 53½, and longitude
103. This trader was equally successful.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Henry's
expedition.</p>

<p>After a career of some years in the vicinity of Michilimackinac,
of a general character, identical with that pursued
a hundred years before by Groseilliers, another intrepid
trader, Alexander Henry, decided to strike off into the
North-West. He left "the Sault," as Sault Ste. Marie
was called, on the 10th of June, 1775, with goods
and provisions to the value of £3,000 sterling,
on board twelve small canoes and four larger
ones. Each small canoe was navigated by three
men, and each larger one by four. On the 20th they encamped
at the mouth of the Pijitic. It was by this river,
he tells us, that the French ascended in 1750, when they
plundered one of the Company's factories in the bay, and
carried off the two small pieces of brass cannon, which fell
again into English hands at Michilimackinac. But here
Henry fell into error; for it was by the River Michipicoten
that the French went, and the factory plundered of its
adornments was Moose, not Churchill, and the year 1756,
not 1750.</p>

<p>Henry himself was going on a sort of plundering expedition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
against the Company, which was to be far more effective
in setting an example to others, than any the French had yet
carried through. Everywhere as he passed along there were
evidences of the recent French occupation.</p>

<p>To return to 1767, this year had witnessed a clearing up of
the mystery surrounding the fate of the <i>Albany</i>, the first of the
vessels sent by the Company to search for a north-west passage.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0307" id="im_0307"></a>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">Fate of
the "Albany."</p>

<p>The Company was at that time carrying on a black whale
fishery, and Marble Island was made the rendezvous, not
merely on account of the commodious harbour, but because
of the greater abundance of whales there. Under these circumstances
the boats, when on the lookout for fish, had frequent
occasion to row close to the island, which led to the discovery,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
at the easternmost extremity, of a new harbour.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
Upon landing at this place, the crews made a startling discovery.
They found English guns, anchors, cables, bricks, a
smith's anvil, and many other articles lying on the ground,
which, though they were very old, had not been defaced
by the hand of time, and which having been apparently
without use to the native Esquimaux, and too heavy to
be removed by them, had not been removed from the
spot where they had originally been laid a little farther
inland. The whalers beheld the remains of a frame
house,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> which, though half destroyed by the Esquimaux for
the wood and iron, yet could plainly be seen at a distance.
Lastly, when the tide ebbed in the harbour there became
visible the hulls of two craft, lying sunk in five
fathoms of water. The figurehead of one of
these vessels, together with the guns and other
implements, was shortly afterwards carried to England. The
hypothesis of Governor Norton was instantly and only too
correctly espoused by the Company. On this inhospitable
island, where neither stick nor stump was, nor is to be seen,
and which lies sixteen miles from a mainland, no less inhospitable,
perished Knight, Barlow, and the other members of
the exploring expedition of 1719. Thus was a fate nearly
half a century in the balance ascertained at last.</p>

<p>Two years later some members of a whaling party landed
at this same harbour, and one of their number, perceiving
some aged Esquimaux, determined to question them on the
matter.</p>

<p>"This," says the narrator, "we were the better enabled to
do by the assistance of an Esquimau, who was then in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
Company's service as a linguist, and annually sailed in one of
their vessels in that character. The account received from
these aged natives was 'full, clear and unreserved,' and its
purport was in this wise:</p>

<p>"When the doomed vessels arrived at Marble Island, it
was late in the autumn of 1719, and in making the harbour
through the ice, the larger was considerably damaged. The
party landed safely, however, and at once set about building
the house. As soon as the ice permitted, in the following
summer, the Esquimaux paid them a further visit, and
observed that the white strangers were largely reduced in
number and that the survivors were very unhealthy in appearance.
According to the account given by these Esquimaux,
these were very busily employed, but the nature of their
employment they could not easily describe. It is probable
they were lengthening the long-boat or repairing the ship,
and to support this conjecture, forty-eight years later there
lay, at a little distance from the house, a quantity of oak
chips, 'most assuredly made by carpenters.'"</p>

<p>Much havoc must have been thenceforward wrought among
the explorers, who could not repair their ship, which even
may by this time have been sunk; and by the second winter,
only twenty souls out of fifty remained.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Wretched
death of
Knight and
his men.</p>

<p>That same winter, some of the Esquimaux had taken up
their abode on the opposite side of the harbour to the English,
and frequently supplied them with such provisions as
they had, which consisted chiefly of whale's blubber, seal's
flesh and train oil. When the spring advanced, the natives
crossed over to the mainland, and upon visiting Marble
Island in the summer of 1721 found only five of the white
men alive, and those in such distress that they instantly
seized upon and devoured the seal's flesh and whale blubber,
given them in trade by their visitors, in a raw
state. This occasioned a severe physical disorder
which destroyed three of the five; and
the other two, though very weak made shift to
bury their dead comrades. These two survivors eked out
a wretched existence for many weeks, frequently resorting to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
the summit of an adjacent rock, in the vain hope of being
seen by some relief party. But alas, they were doomed to a
daily disappointment; the Esquimaux themselves had little
to offer them; and at last they were seen by the wandering
natives to crouch down close together and cry aloud like
children, the tears rolling down their cheeks. First one of
the pair died, and then the other, in an attempt to dig a
grave for his fellow. The Esquimau who told the story, led
the whalers to the spot and showed them the skulls and the
larger bones of the luckless pair, then lying above ground
not a great distance from the dwelling. It is believed that
the last survivor must have been the armourer or smith of the
expedition, because according to the account given by the
aborigines, he was always employed in working iron into
implements for them, some of which they could still show.</p>

<p>There flourished in 1768 the body known as the "Royal
Society for Improving Natural Knowledge." This society
wrote to the Company, requesting that two persons might be
conveyed to and from Fort Churchill in Hudson's Bay, in some
of the Company's ships, "to observe the passage of Venus over
the sun, which will happen on the 3rd of June, 1769." It was
desired that these persons might be maintained by the Company,
and furnished with all necessary articles while on board
and on shore. The Company was asked to furnish them with
materials and the assistance of servants to erect an observatory;
the Society engaging to recoup the Company's whole
charge, and desiring an estimate of the expense.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Astronomers
at Hudson's
Bay, 1769.</p>

<p>The Company expressed itself as "ready to convey the
persons desired, with their baggage and instruments, to and
from Fort Churchill, and to provide them with
lodging and medicine while there, <i>gratis</i>, they
to find their own bedding." The Company
demanded £250 for diet during the absence of
the astronomers from England, which would be about eighteen
months. The Adventurers recommended the Society
to send the intended building in frame, with all necessary
implements, tools, etc., which "will be conveyed upon freight,
the Royal Society likewise paying for any clothing that may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
be supplied the observers during their residence in Hudson's
Bay."</p>

<p>It is interesting to record that the expedition was entirely
successful. The two astronomers went out to Prince of
Wales' Fort, and returned in the <i>Prince Rupert</i>, after having
witnessed the transit of Venus on the 3rd of June, 1769.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the century there had grown up
a deep prejudice and opposition towards the Hudson's Bay
Company from the sailors and watermen who frequented the
Thames.</p>

<p>It was alleged that the Company did nothing to make itself
popular; its rules were strict and its wages to seamen were
low, albeit it had never suffered very much from this prejudice
until the return of the Middleton expedition. Many absurd
stories became current as to the Company's policy and the
life led by the servants at the factories. These travellers'
tales had been thoroughly threshed out by the enquiry of
1749. The opponents of the Company had told their "shocking
narratives." It was only natural, perhaps, that these
should be passed about from mouth to mouth, and so become
exaggerated beyond bounds. Upon the discharge and death
of Captain Coats a demonstration against the Company had
been talked of at Wapping and Gravesend, but nothing came
of it but a few hootings and bawlings as the ships sailed away
on their annual voyages to the Bay.</p>

<p>By 1768, however, the dissatisfaction had spread to the
Company's own seamen, and now took an active form. The
time was well chosen by the malcontents, because the public
were ready at that time to sympathize with the movement for
the amelioration of the conditions which characterized the
merchant service generally.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Company's
seamen
strike.</p>

<p>A numerous body of seamen forcibly entered the Company's
ships in the River Thames, demanding
that wages should be raised to 40s. per month.
They struck the topgallant masts and yards, and
lowered the lower yards close down, and got
them in fore and aft. The consequence was that the crews
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
of the Company's ships and brigantine were compelled to
quit their vessels.</p>

<p>The moment the tidings of this reached the Governor
and Company it was deemed advisable for the Deputy Governor,
Thomas Berens and James Fitzgerald, Esquires, to
"attend his Majesty's principal Secretaries of State, and
such other gentlemen in the Administration as they shall
find necessary, and represent the urgent situation of the Company's
affairs in general."</p>

<p>This was done forthwith, and the facts of the situation
placed before Viscount Weymouth and Sir Edward Hawke
First Lord of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Weymouth appeared well disposed to do
all the service in his power to redress the present grievances;
that a memorial should be presented on the Company's behalf.</p>

<p>While the memorial was being drawn up, the three captains
acquainted the Commissioners that under the present disturbances
on the River Thames, they should not be able to secure
the seamen they had already got, without allowing their sailors
40s. per month. It was then the 18th of May, and the Company
considered that the lives of its servants abroad, and the
event of the intended voyage, would not admit of delay.
They therefore told their three captains, and the master of
the <i>Charlotte</i>, brigantine, that they would allow the sailors
35s. per month from their respective entries to this day,
inclusive, and 40s. per month from this day for their voyage
out and home.</p>

<p>Hardly had this been done than a letter was received
expressing Lord Weymouth's great concern on being informed
that the Company's ships had been prevented from sailing
until a promise was made to raise the seamen's wages, and
that some acts of violence had been committed to effect
their purpose. From the strong assurance his Lordship had
received that there was no danger of any obstacle to delay
the voyages, he was almost ready to doubt the rumour.</p>

<p>Berens called on Weymouth and informed him that the
Company's critical situation had already obliged the Company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
to acquiesce in the demand of 40s. per month for the seamen's
wages. No acts of violence were committed on board the
Company's ship, other than that the crews were daily forced
against their inclination to join the rioters.</p>

<p>The ships were at length got down to Greenwich and proceeded
on their voyage with despatch.</p>

<p>But the Company was not yet out of the wood. Clandestine
trade was to be again its bogey. The disaffection had
been temporarily arrested amongst the sailors: but they were
hardly prepared to learn that it extended to the captains
themselves, who had, however, the best of reasons for concealing
their feelings. When the ships came home in the
following year the Company received information that a
seizure of furs and other valuable goods brought from Hudson's
Bay had been made since the arrival of the Company's
ships that season. Communication was entered into with the
Commissioners of Customs requesting a particular account
of such seizures either from the Company's ships or other
places, "in order that the Commissioners may pursue an
enquiry for detecting the frauds that have been committed
to the prejudice of His Majesty's Revenue and the interest
of the Company."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Clandestine
trade by the
Company's
captains.</p>

<p>Suspicion for the loss of numerous packages of furs now
began to fasten itself upon one of the Company's captains,
Horner of the <i>Seahorse</i>. Horner acknowledged
that he was not altogether ignorant that the
furs had been abstracted from the hold of his
ship. The Company deliberated on his case, and
it was "unanimously resolved that the said John
Horner be discharged from the Company's service." The other
captains were now called in and acquainted with the reasons
for Captain Horner's discharge. The Adventurers declared
their determination to make the like public example of all
persons who should be found to be concerned in clandestine
trade.</p>

<p>In the following year the Company came to a wise decision.
Taking into consideration the state of its trade and the many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
frauds that "have been practised and detected," it was concluded
that such frauds were connived at by the Company's
chief factors and captains, who were not only privy thereto,
but in consideration for some joint interest, permitted this
illicit trade to be carried on.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Salaries
increased.</p>

<p>The Company seems to have thought that the chief factors
and captains might have been tempted to these nefarious
practices by the smallness of their respective salaries, and
therefore in the hope of securing their fidelity and encouraging
diligence and industry, and the extending of the Company's
trade to the utmost to the benefit of the Company and
the revenue, it was decided that a salary of £130 per annum
be allowed the chief factors at York, Albany,
and Prince of Wales' Fort; also the factors
about to be appointed at Moose Fort and
Severn House, "in lieu of former salaries, and
all trapping gratuities, and perquisites whatever, except a
servant, which is to be allowed to them as before."</p>

<p>A gratuity was to be given to all chief factors of three
shillings upon every score of made beaver which they consigned
and "which shall actually be brought home to the
Company's account."</p>

<p>To the captains a gratuity was decreed of one shilling and
sixpence per score of made beaver which they should bring
to the Company's warehouse in good saleable condition.</p>

<p>To prevent any loss from rioters or dissatisfied sailors the
Company decided, in 1770, to insure their ships and goods for
the first time in its history. The secretary made enquiries at
the London Assurance Office, and reported that the premium
would be five per cent. per annum on each ship during their
being in dock, or on the River Thames above Gravesend; and
the same on the ships' stores while they continued in the
Company's warehouse at Ratcliff. Whereupon the Company
insured each of its three ships for £2,000, and the ships' stores
in the above warehouse for £3,000.

</p>

<p class="sidenote">The "Great
River."</p>

<p>Some northern Indians, who came to trade at Prince of
Wales' Fort in the spring of 1768, brought further accounts of
the "Great River," as they persisted in calling it, and also
produced several pieces of copper, as specimens
of a mine long believed by the traders to exist
in the vicinity. This determined Governor
Norton to represent it to the Company as a
matter well worthy their attention. As he went that year to
England, he was given the opportunity of doing so in
person; and in consequence of his representations, the
Committee resolved to despatch an intelligent person by land
to observe the latitude and longitude of the river's mouth, and
to make a chart of the country traversed, with such observations
as might lead to a better knowledge of the region.
An intelligent mariner, Samuel Hearne, then in the Company's
employ as mate of the brig <i>Charlotte</i>, was selected
for the mission.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Hearne's
expedition
of discovery.</p>

<p>Before starting on his journey in 1769, Hearne received full
instructions from Moses Norton, the Governor. He was provided
with an escort and was urged to cultivate, as he went,
friendly relations with the Indians. "Smoke your calumet
of peace with their leaders in order to establish a friendship
with them." He was equipped with instruments, and was
required to take account of latitude and longitude of the
chief points visited; he was to seek for a
north-west passage through the continent.
But a more immediate and practical matter
was dwelt upon in his letter. "Be careful to
observe what mines are near the river,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> what water there is
at the river's mouth, how far the woods are from the seaside,
the course of the river, the nature of the soil, and the productions
of it; and make any other remarks that you may think
will be either necessary or satisfactory. And if the said river
be likely to be of any utility, take possession of it on behalf
of the Hudson's Bay Company by cutting your name on
some of the rocks, and also the date of the year, month, etc."</p>

<p>Hearne promised to follow these instructions implicitly,
and soon after daybreak on the morning of the 6th of
November, the occupants of the fort assembled to witness the
intrepid explorer's departure. A salute of seven guns and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
ringing cheer thrice repeated was responded to by Hearne,
already on his way, with a wave of his cap.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0317" id="im_0317"></a>
<img src="images/im_0317.jpg" width="400" height="449" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Dobbs' Map, 1744.</span></p>
</div>

<p>He had not gone far, however, when dissatisfaction broke
out amongst his party. First one Indian guide deserted him
and then another; but trusting to the fidelity of the rest
Hearne pressed forward. At last, nearly the whole party
left him, taking at the same time several bags of powder
and shot, his hatchets, chisels and files. His chief guide,
Chaw-chin-ahaw, now advised the explorer to return, and
announced his own intention of travelling to his own tribe
in the south-west.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span></p>

<p>"Thus," says Hearne, "they set out, making the woods
ring with their laughter, and left us to consider our unhappy
situation, nearly two hundred miles from Prince of Wales'
Fort, all heavily laden, and in strength and spirits greatly
reduced by hunger and fatigue."</p>

<p>Mortifying as the prospect of return was, it was inevitable.
They arrived on the 11th of December, to the astonishment
of Norton and the Company's servants.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Second
expedition.</p>

<p>But Hearne was not to be daunted. On the 23rd of
February he again set out with five Indians. This time his
journey was a succession of short stages, with
intervals of a whole day's rest between. These
intervals were occupied in killing deer, or in
seeking for fish under the ice with nets. On
one occasion they spent a day in building a more permanent
tent, where they waited for the flights of goose to appear.</p>

<p>The course had been in a general north-western direction
from the Churchill River, but on the 10th of June the party
abandoned the rivers and lakes and struck out into the barren
lands. The following narrative by Hearne is interesting,
because up to that moment no servant of the Company had
ever seen a live musk ox, that "now rare denizen of the
northern solitudes."</p>

<p>"We had not walked above seven or eight miles before we
saw three musk oxen grazing by the side of a small lake.
The Indians immediately went in pursuit of them, and as
some were expert hunters they soon killed the whole of them.
This was, no doubt, very fortunate, but to our great mortification
before we could get one of them skinned, such a fall
of rain came on as to put it out of our power to make a fire,
which, even in the finest weather, could only be made of moss,
as we were nearly a hundred miles from any woods. This was
poor comfort for people who had not broken their fast for
four or five days. Necessity, however, has no law, and having
before been initiated into the method of eating raw meat, we
were the better prepared for this repast. But this was by no
means so well relished, either by me or the Southern Indians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
as either raw venison or raw fish had been; for the flesh of
the musk-ox is not only coarse and tough, but smells and
tastes so strong of musk as to make it very disagreeable when
raw, though it is tolerable eating when properly cooked. The
weather continued so remarkably bad, accompanied with constant
heavy rain, snow and sleet, and our necessities were so
great by the time the weather permitted us to make a fire,
that we had nearly eaten to the amount of one buffalo quite
raw."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Hardships
of the
journey.</p>

<p>What severities of hardship were endured by our traveller
may be judged from his description. "We have fasted many
times," he declares, "two whole days and nights; twice upwards
of three days, and once, while at Shethaunee, near
seven days, during which we tasted not a mouthful
of anything except a few cranberries, water,
scraps of old leather and burnt bones. On
these pressing occasions I have frequently seen
the Indians examine their wardrobe, which consisted chiefly
of skin clothing, and consider what part could best be spared;
sometimes a piece of an old, half-rotten deerskin, and others
a pair of old shoes, were sacrificed to alleviate extreme
hunger."</p>

<p>It was while in the midst of these sufferings and bitter
experiences, which required all the traveller's courage to
endure that a disaster of a different order happened. It
was the 11th of August. Hearne had reached a point some
five hundred miles north-west of Churchill. It proving rather
windy at noon, although otherwise fine, he had let his valuable
quadrant stand, in order to obtain the latitude more exactly
by two altitudes. He then retired to eat his mid-day meal.
Suddenly he was startled by a crash, and looking in the
direction, found that a gust of wind had overturned the
instrument and sent it crashing to earth. As the ground
where it stood was very stony, the bubble, sight-vane and
vernier were entirely broken to pieces, and the instrument thus
destroyed. In consequence of this misfortune, the traveller
resolved to retrace his steps wearily back to Prince of Wales'
Fort.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span></p>

<p>When he had arrived at Churchill River he had met the
friendly chief, Matonabee,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> who at once, and with charming
simplicity, volunteered a reason for the troubles which had
overtaken the white explorer. He had taken no women with
him on his journey. Said Matonabee:</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Indian's
estimate of
woman.</p>

<p>"When all the men are heavy-laden they can neither hunt
nor travel to any considerable distance; and in case they
meet with success in hunting, who is to carry the product of
their labour? Women," added he, "were made for labour;
one of them carry or haul as much as two men
can do. They also pitch our tents, make and
mend our clothing, keep up our fires at night,
and, in fact, there is no such thing as travelling
any considerable distance, or for any length of time, in this
country, without their assistance. Women," he observed
again, "though they do everything, are maintained at a
trifling expense, for as they always act as cooks, the very
licking of their fingers in scarce times is sufficient for their
subsistence."</p>

<p>Hearne did not reach the fort till towards the close of
November. On the 21st he thus describes the weather:
"That night we lay on the south shore of Egg River, but
long before daybreak the next morning, the weather being so
bad, with a violent gale of wind from the north-west, and such
a drift of snow that we could not have a bit of fire; and as
no good woods were near to afford us shelter, we agreed to
proceed on our way, especially as the wind was on our backs;
and though the weather was bad near the surface we could
frequently see the moon and sometimes the stars, to direct us
in our course. In this situation we continued walking the
whole day, and it was not until after ten at night that we
could find the smallest tuft of wood to put up in; for though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
we well knew we must have passed by several hummocks of
shrubby wood that might have afforded us some shelter, yet
the wind blew so hard and the snow drifted so excessively
thick that we could not see ten yards before us the whole
day."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0322" id="im_0322"></a>
<img src="images/im_0322.jpg" width="550" height="385" alt="Indian with dog team" />
</div>

<p>That night his dog, a valuable animal, was frozen to death,
and after that there was nothing for it but he must himself
haul his heavy sledge over the snowdrifts.</p>

<p>Twice baffled, yet the intrepid explorer was far from being
swerved from his purpose. Not even the distrust of Norton,
who wrote home to the Company that Hearne was unfit for
the task in hand, could discourage him from making a third
attempt. On this journey, his plan was to secure the company
and assistance of Matonabee, and three or four of the
best Indians under that chief; and this was put into practice
on the 7th of December, 1770. This time the departure took
place under different auspices. There was no firing of cannon
from the fort, no cheering, and no hearty Godspeeds from the
Governor and his staff.</p>

<p>Again, similar adventures to those encountered the first two
journeys were met with. Hearne cultivated the friendship of
strange, but not hostile, savages as he went along. In one
locality he took part in "snaring deer in a pound," or large
stockade. The rest of the winter was spent in such a succession
of advances as the weather and state of the country
permitted. In April it was possible to obtain supplies of
birch wood staves for tent poles, and birch rind and timber
for building canoes. Spring enabled the party to proceed
with greater rapidity, and at last a rendezvous at a place
called Clowey was reached. From this point the final dash
for the Coppermine River, the main object of the expedition,
must be made. At Clowey some hundreds of Indians joined
the little party to proceed to the Coppermine, and thus it
grew suddenly into a military expedition, for the tribe was
bent on making war on the Esquimaux, should the latter be
discovered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">The expedition
reaches
the Arctic.</p>

<p>The long-desired spot was attained at last. On the 14th of
July Hearne and his party looked out over the
dancing surface of the Coppermine River, and
descending this stream to its mouth beheld the
Arctic Ocean. Hearne thus being the first
white man to reach the northern sea from the interior.</p>

<p>Says the explorer: "In those high latitudes, and at this
season of the year, the sun is always at a good height over
the horizon, so that we not only had daylight, but sunshine
the whole night; a thick fog and drizzling rain then came on,
and finding that neither the river nor sea were likely to be of
any use, I did not think it worth while to wait for fair weather
to determine the latitude exactly by an observation. For the
sake of form, however, after having had some consultation
with the Indians, I erected a mark and took possession of the
coast, on behalf of the Hudson's Bay Company. I was
not provided with instruments for cutting on stone, but
I cut my name, date of the year, etc., on a piece of
board that had been one of the Indian's targets, and placed it
in a heap of stones on a small eminence near the entrance of
the river, on the south side."</p>

<p>"It is, indeed," remarks Hearne, "well known to the intelligent
and well-informed part of the Company's servants, that
an extensive and numerous tribe of Indians, called E-arch-e-thinnews,
whose country lies far west of any of the Company's
or Canadian settlements, must have traffic with the Spaniards
on the west side of the continent; because some of the
Indians who formerly traded to York Fort, when at war with
those people, frequently found saddles, bridles, muskets, and
many other articles in their possession which were undoubtedly
of Spanish manufacture."<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Hearne returns
to England.</p>

<p>Hearne went home to England and related his experiences
in a paper read before his employers, the Honorable Adventurers.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
It was not until some years later that it was discovered
that he had, either in ignorance or,
according to one of his enemies named Dalrymple,
"in a desire to increase the value of his
performance," placed the latitude of the Coppermine
at nearly 71 degrees north instead of at about 67½
degrees. Hearne's own apology was that after the breaking
of his quadrant<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> on the second expedition, he was forced to
employ an old Elton quadrant, which had for thirty years
been amongst the relics and rubbish of Prince of Wales' Fort.
But the geographical societies were indignant at having been
thus imposed upon.</p>

<p>"I cannot help observing," wrote Hearne, "that I feel myself
rather hurt at Mr. Dalrymple's rejecting my latitude in so
peremptory a manner and in so great a proportion as he has
done; because before I arrived at Cange-cath-a-whachaga,
the sun did not set during the whole night, a proof that I was
then to the northward of the Arctic circle."</p>

<p>Hearne's journey, considering the epoch in which it was
undertaken, the life led by the Company's servants at the
forts, and the terrible uncertainties incident to plunging into
an icy wilderness, with no security against hunger or the
attacks of savages, was greater than it really appeared, and
without doubt paved the way for the Company's new policy.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span></p>

<p>With the ship which brought Hearne over from England
came a large number of young Orkney Islanders.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Company employ
Orkney
Islanders.</p>

<p>The labouring servants, as has been seen, were first in 1712,
and from about 1775 onwards, procured from the Orkney
Islands, their wages being about £6 a year. They were
engaged by the captains of the ships, usually for a period of
five years. Each servant signed a contract on his entrance
into the service to serve for the term and not to return home
until its expiration, unless recalled by the Company. He
engaged during his passage back to do duty as watch on
board ship without extra pay; but that which
was the last and principal clause of the agreement
related to illicit trading. He was bound
in the most solemn manner not to detain,
secrete, harbour or possess any skin or part of a skin, on any
pretence whatever; but on the contrary, he was to search after
and detect all persons who might be disposed to engage in
this species of speculation. Should he detect any such, he
was to expose them to the Governor. If contrary to this
agreement, any persons should be found bold enough to conceal
any peltry or otherwise infringe his contract, they were to
forfeit all the wages due them by the Company. Although a
further penalty was nominally exacted under the contract,
that of a fine of two years' pay, it was rarely carried into
effect, and then only when the delinquent was believed to
have largely profited by his illegal transaction.</p>

<p>In the early days when a servant's time expired and he was
about to return home, the Governor in person was supposed
to inspect his chest, even examining his bedding and other
effects, to see that it contained not even the smallest marten
skin. An almost equally rigorous surveillance attended the
sending of private letters and parcels, not merely in the Bay
alone, but in London. In the latter case, the parcel of
clothing, etc., intended for the Company's distant servant, was
first obliged to be sent to the Hudson's Bay House, and
there undergo a careful examination for fear it should
contain anything used in private trade.</p>

<p>During the time that the Indians were at the posts trading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
their furs, the gates were continually kept closed, it being the
regular employment of one person to see that no one made
his exit for fear he should attempt a private barter with the
Indians. While this rule was rarely relaxed, yet it was not
at all of the forts that a too strict watch was kept on the
movements of the employees. At York Fort, however,
during the eighteenth century, if a servant wished to take a
walk on a Sunday afternoon, at a time when no natives were
trading, it was first necessary to apply to the Governor for
leave.</p>

<p>Of the run of the Company's servants in the latter half of
the eighteenth century, a writer of that day has said of them:
"They are a close, prudent, quiet people, strictly faithful to
their employers," adding that they were "sordidly avaricious."</p>

<p>Whilst these young Scotchmen were scattered about the
country in small parties amongst the Indians, their general
behaviour won them the respect of the savages, as well as
procured them their protection. It is a significant fact that
for the first fifteen years of the new <i>régime</i> the Company did
not suffer the loss of a single man, notwithstanding that their
servants were annually exposed to all the dangers incident to
the trade and times.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Character of
the Company's
traders.</p>

<p>It was observed that very few of the Canadian servants
were to be entirely trusted with even a small assortment of
goods, unless some substantial guarantee were first exacted.
The chances were ten to one that the master
would be defrauded of the whole stock of merchandise,
often through the medium of the
Indian women, who were quick to perceive
what an easy prey was the one and how difficult the other.
The French-Canadian traders were brave and hardy; apt in
learning the habits and language of the Indians; dexterous
canoemen and of a lively, not to say boisterous, disposition;
but none of these qualities, nor all together, were often the
means of earning the respect and trust of the natives. And it
must not be imagined that these talents and accomplishments
were limited to the Canadians, even in the earliest days of
rivalry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span></p>

<p>"Though such may be the sentiments of their employers,"
wrote one of the Company's factors, "let these gentlemen for
a while look around them and survey without prejudice the
inhabitants of our own hemisphere, and they will find people
who are brought up from their infancy to hardships, and
inured to the inclemency of the weather from their earliest
days; they will also find people who might be trusted with
thousands, and who are much too familiarized to labour and
fatigue to repine under the pressure of calamity as long as
their own and their master's benefit is in view. I will further
be bold to say that the present servants of the Company may
be led as far inland as navigation is practicable, with more
ease and satisfaction to the owners, than the same number of
Canadians."</p>

<p>The former, it was noted, would be always honest, tractable
and obedient, as well from inclination as from fear of losing
their pecuniary expectations; whereas the latter, being
generally in debt, and having neither good name, integrity
nor property to lose, were always neglectful of the property
committed to their charge. Whenever difficulties arose
there was never wanting some amongst them to impede
the undertaking.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The council
at the forts.</p>

<p>The Governor at each factory occasionally had a person to
act with him, who was known as the second or under-factor.
These, with the surgeon and the master of the sloop, constituted
a council, who were supposed to deliberate
in cases of emergency or upon affairs of
importance. Amongst the latter were classed
the reading of the Company's general letter, received annually
and inditing a reply to it; the encroachments of their
French, at a later period, Canadian rivals; or the misbehaviour
of the servants. In these councils very little regard,
it seems, was paid to the opinion of the subordinate members,
who rather desired to obtain the Governor's favour by
acquiescence rather than his resentment by opposition.</p>

<p>The Governors were appointed for either three or five
years, and their nominal salary was from £50 to £150 per
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
annum, which the premium on the trade often trebled and
sometimes quadrupled. These officials commonly reigned as
absolute in their petty commands as Eastern Nabobs; and as
it was in a Governor's power to render the lives of those under
them happy or unhappy as they chose, it was only natural
that the inferior servants were most diligent in cultivating
their good will. It was out of the power, of course, for any
aggrieved or dissatisfied servant to return home until the
ships came, and if he then persisted in his intention, the payment
of his wages was withheld until the Company should
decide upon his character, which was furnished in writing by
the Governor. Although the voice of an inferior servant
counted but little when opposed to the Governor, yet there
are few instances when the Company, in parting with a
servant, refused him his wages in full.</p>

<p>It is an old axiom that austerity is acquired by a term of
absolute petty dominion, so that it is not remarkable that the
Company's early Governors were distinguished by this trait
in the fullest degree.</p>

<p>"I had an opportunity," wrote one former factor, "of being
acquainted with many Governors in my time. I could single
out several whose affability and capacity merited a better
employment. Some I have known who despised servility
and unworthy deeds; but this was only for a time, and while
young in their stations."</p>

<p>Such criticism, while doubtless unjust, had yet, applied
generally, a basis of truth.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Character of
the trading
governors.</p>

<p>Robson complains of a Governor at Churchill, in his time,
who had a thousand times rendered himself obnoxious to
society. But perhaps the Company had never in its employ
a more eccentric and choleric official than the governor who
was in command of York Factory from 1773 to 1784. It is
said of him that his bad name extended even across the
Atlantic and reached the Orkney Isles, where
the malevolence of his disposition became a
by-word, and restrained many youths from
entering the Company's service. Intoxication
seems to have been this Governor's principal delight, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
this was often gratified at the expense of common prudence,
as when the French captured York Factory in 1782; no
common spirits being on hand, he procured raw alcohol
from the surgeon, of which he drank several bumpers to raise
his courage.</p>

<p>Although most of the Company's early trading Governors
were, in spite of their tempers and habits, persons of education
and intelligence, yet there were occasional exceptions.
One, Governor Hughes, was said to be incapable of casting up
a simple sum in addition; numeral characters being almost
unknown to him; nor was his success in writing his own
name greater. Yet his courage and business ability was
beyond question.</p>

<p>It has already been observed that the Company were accustomed
to treat with much deference, and to place great
reliance upon their chief factors while these were at their posts
in the Bay; yet it must not be supposed that the same consideration
was extended to them on their return home. A
Governor, it was said by one of the Company's servants,
might attend the Hudson's Bay House, and walk about their
Hall for a whole day without the least notice being taken of
his attendance. It is related that one such Governor, after
having served the Company for a matter of seventeen years,
went home in 1782, expecting to reap in person some of the
rewards of his faithful service in the compliments and attentions
of the Adventurers as a body. But, to his chagrin, not
the slightest notice was taken of him, and he returned without
having even been introduced to a single partner.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Death of
Governor
Norton.</p>

<p>On the 29th of December, 1773, there died one of the
notable characters in the Bay, Governor Moses Norton.
Norton was an Indian half-breed, the son of a previous
Governor, Richard Norton. He was born at Prince of Wales'
Fort, but had been in England nine years, and
considering the small sum spent on his education,
had made considerable progress in literature.
At his return to the Bay, according to
Hearne, he entered into all the abominable vices of his countrymen.
He established a seraglio, in which figured five or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
six of the most comely Indian maidens. Yet, although
somewhat lax in his morality himself, he seems to have been
by no means indulgent to others. To his own friends and
relatives, the Indians and half-breeds, it is said, he was "so
partial that he set more value on, and showed more respect
to, one of their favourite dogs than he ever did to his first
officer." This is probably a spiteful exaggeration, but it is
certain that Norton, although a man of ability, was not very
popular. His great desire was to excite admiration for his
skilful use of drugs. "He always," declared one of the
Governor's enemies, "kept about him a box of poison to
administer to those who refused him their wives or daughters."
With all these bad qualities, no man took greater pains to
inculcate virtue, morality and continence upon others; always
painting in the most glaring colours the jealous and revengeful
disposition of the Indians, when any attempt was made
to violate the chastity of their wives and daughters.</p>

<p>His apartments at the fort were not only convenient, but
had some pretensions to elegance, and were always crowded
with his favourites. As this Governor advanced in years, his
jealousy increased, and it is said he actually poisoned two of
his women because he thought they had transferred their
affections elsewhere. He had the reputation of being a most
notorious smuggler; but though he put many thousands into
the pockets of the Company's captains, he seldom put a
shilling into his own.</p>

</p>

<p>The Company was not immediately advised of the ruinous
proceedings of the Montreal traders by its governors at York
and Churchill. But at length the diminution of trade became
marked. The Indians continued to bring in reports of other
white traders speaking English, who intercepted them and
gave them trinkets and rum in exchange for their furs. They
declared they were conscious of having made a bad bargain
in not continuing onward to the Company's posts, but what
could they do? "The <i>Bostonnais</i><a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> was cunning and he
deceived the Indian." At last, in view of this, it was felt
that further delay were folly.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cumberland
House built.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1773 instructions were sent out to Governor
Norton to despatch Hearne westward and establish a post in
the interior. By this time the rival Canadian
traders had carried the trade beyond the French
limits, although, for reasons to be disclosed, all
their activity was in vain, so far as material results either to
themselves or their employers or capitalists were concerned,
not to mention the aborigines themselves.</p>

<p>Hearne hit upon what he considered a good site for the
new post at Sturgeon Lake, on the eastern bank, in latitude
53°, 56 and longitude 102°, 15. The post prospered almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
from its foundation. The neighbouring tribes found that here
were to be procured a larger and better assortment of goods
than the Canadians brought them, and frequented it in
preference.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>For several years now a trade with the Indians had been
carried on in the footsteps of the French license-holders.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0333" id="im_0333"></a>
<img src="images/im_0333.jpg" width="406" height="239" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Visit to an Indian Encampment.</span></p>
</div>

<p>What was to be expected when the character of the
Montreal traders themselves, and the commerce they prosecuted,
was considered, soon happened. This army of half-wild
men, armed to the teeth, unhampered by legal restraint,
constantly drinking, carousing and quarrelling amongst themselves,
gradually spread over the north-west, sowing crime
and anarchy wherever they went. The country they traded
in was so distant, and their method of transportation so slow,
that they were fortunate if they reached their winter quarters
without leaving the corpses of several of their number to
mark their path.</p>

<p>Was it singular that trade carried on in such a fashion, and
with results so ruinous, should cause the "partners," as these
unhappy individuals, who had furnished the funds, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
called, to contemplate the future with dismay? Season after
season the "winterers" returned to the Grand Portage with
the same tale; and season after season were better profits
promised, but never, alas, for their dupes, were these promises
fulfilled!</p>

<p class="sidenote">Frobisher
intercepts
Company's
Indians.</p>

<p>Matters were thus going from bad to worse in this way,
when one sober and enterprising trader, Joseph Frobisher,
resolved to leave the beaten track and penetrate nearer to the
Company's Factory, at Churchill, than had yet been done.
In the spring of 1775, as a band of Indians were on their
way as usual to Prince of Wales' Fort, they
were met by Frobisher, who caused them to halt
and to drink and smoke with him. The chiefs
imagined he was one of the Company's factors,
and Frobisher did not choose to undeceive them.
His wares being of a better quality than those of his compeers,
the Indians suffered themselves to be persuaded to
trade on the spot, which was at a portage afterwards called
by the Montreal traders La Traite, on account of this episode.
The Indians, nevertheless, resumed their journey to Churchill
River, where the indignation of Hearne and the Council knew
no bounds. He informed the Indians that a "scurvy trick"
had been played upon them; and so characterized it in his
journal. A few having still some of the heavier furs by
them, were paid double, as an encouragement to their future
discrimination. Nevertheless, in spite of all, the "scurvy
trick" was repeated by Frobisher the following year, both
times securing enormous booty.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span></p>

<p>The difficulties and sufferings of these two undertakings,
however, affected him with a distaste for a repetition; but he
sent his brother Benjamin to explore the region still farther.
This he accomplished, going as far west as the Lake of Isle a
la Crosse.</p>

<p>The difficulties of transport are pointed out in letters of
Frobisher and McGill. The value of each canoe load, on
arrival at Michilimackinac, had been estimated, in 1780, to be
£660 currency, equal to $2,640, showing the cost of transport
by the Ottawa to have been $640 for each canoe; the value
at Montreal having been $2,000. In April, 1784, Benjamin
Frobisher wrote that twenty-eight canoes were ready to be
sent off, valued at £20,000 currency, or $80,000, a sum for
each canoe largely in excess of the estimate of four years
before.</p>

<p>Frobisher's success in intercepting the Company's Indians
induced others to attempt a similar course. The idea was, of
course, to give goods of a better character, and to travel so far
into the savage country as to relieve the Indian, who always
contemplated the annual journey to the Company's post with
repugnance of such necessity. In 1779 Peter Pond, an able,
but desperate character, was the first to attempt storing such
goods as he could not bring back immediately, in one of the
wintering huts at Elk River, against his return the following
season. This imitation of a Company's post proved
successful, and led to its being repeated on a larger scale.</p>

<p>But matters were not equally propitious with the vast bulk
of the peddlers, bushrangers, swashbucklers, and drunken half-breeds
who were comprised in the Canadian trading fraternity.
A numerous crew of them got from their winter quarters at
Saskatchewan to the Eagle Hills in the spring of 1780. Here
they held high carouse amidst a body of Indians as drunken,
and much more noisy and abandoned, as themselves. One of
the traders becoming tired of the continued application of an
Indian for more grog, gave him a dose of laudanum. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
savage thereupon staggered a few steps away, lay down and
died. A cry went up from the man's wives, a skirmish ensued,
and the sun went down on seven corpses. One of the traders,
two of his men, and four half-breed voyageurs lost their lives,
and the rest were forced to abandon their all and take to
flight.</p>

(<i>From "Picturesque Canada," by permission.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The same spring, two of the Canadian posts on the
Assiniboine River were assailed during a quarrel. Several
white men and a large number of Indians were killed.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Terrible
smallpox
epidemic.</p>

<p>The fearful act of vengeance which might now have been
meditated at this juncture was never carried out,
for in 1781 an epidemic of smallpox broke out,
wreaking a memorable destruction upon all the
Indians of Rupert's Land.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, the extraordinary and fatal facility
with which this disease had always made headway among the
aborigines of the North American continent. There must
have been some predisposition in their constitutions which
rendered them an easy prey to this scourge of Europe. Later,
when the boon, brought into Europe by Lady Mary Montague
arrested and partially disarmed the monster, smallpox had
wrought unmitigated havoc amongst whole tribes and circles
of the Red men, more than decimating the entire population
and occasionally destroying whole camps, while leaving
scarcely more than one shrivelled hag to relate to the
Company's factors the fell tale of destruction.</p>

<p>The scourge which depopulated vast regions naturally
cleared the country of white traders. Two parties did,
indeed, set out from Montreal in 1781-82, with the avowed
intention of making permanent settlements on Churchill River
and at Athabasca. But the smallpox had not yet done its
worst, and drove them back with only seven packages of
beaver. This season was a better one than the preceding for
the Company's factories; but an event now happened scarcely
foreseen by anyone. England and France had been again at
war, but none had as yet dreamt of a sea attack on the Company's
posts in the Bay. Such a thing had not happened for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
upwards of eighty years, and the conquest of Canada seemed
to so preclude its probability that the Adventurers had not
even instructed its governors to be on the alert for a possible
foe.</p>

<p>Up to the era of the terrible smallpox visitation in 1782,
the remote Chippewas and far-off tribes from Athabasca and
the Great Slave Lake, travelling to Prince of Wales' Fort,
must have gazed with wonder at its solid masonry and
formidable artillery. The great cannon whose muzzles stared
grimly from the walls had already been woven into Indian
legend, and the Company's factors were fond of telling how
the visiting Red men stood in astonishment for hours at a
time before this fortress, whose only parallel on the continent
was Quebec itself.</p>

<p class="sidenote">French attack
Fort Prince of
Wales, 1782.</p>

<p>Fort Prince of Wales had been built, as we have seen, at a
time when the remembrance of burned factories and posts
easily captured and pillaged by French and Indians was keen
amongst the Honourable Adventurers. But that remembrance
had long since faded; the reasons for which the fort had been
built had seemingly vanished. Wherefore gradually the garrison
waned in numbers, until on the 8th of August, 1782, only
thirty-nine defenders<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> within its walls witnessed the arrival of
three strange ships in the Bay. Instantly the word ran from
mouth to mouth that they were three French men-of-war.
All was consternation and incredulity at first, quickly succeeded
by anxiety. Two score pair of English
eyes watched the strangers, as pinnace, gig and
long-boat were lowered, and a number of
swarthy whiskered sailors began busily to sound
the approaches to the harbour. As may be believed, an
anxious night was passed in the fort by Governor Samuel
Hearne and his men. Daybreak came and showed the
strangers already disembarking in their boats, and as the
morning sun waxed stronger, an array of four hundred troops
was seen to be drawn up on the shore of Churchill Bay, at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
place called Hare Point. Orders were given to march, and
with the flag of France once more unfurled on these distant
sub-Arctic shores, the French attacking party approached the
Company's stronghold.</p>

<p>When about four hundred yards from the walls they halted,
and two officers were sent on ahead to summon the Governor
to surrender. The French ships turned out to be the <i>Sceptre</i>,
seventy-four guns, the <i>Astarte</i>, and the <i>Engageante</i>, of thirty-six
guns each, and the force possessed besides four field guns,
two mortars, and three hundred bomb-shells. This fleet was
in command of Admiral Pérouse.</p>

<p>It appears that La Pérouse had counted on arriving just in
time to secure a handsome prize in the Company's ships, for
which he had lain in wait in the Bay. Hearne seems to have
been panic-stricken and believed resistance useless.</p>

<p>To the surprise of the French, a table cloth snatched up by
the Governor was soon seen waving from the parapet of the
fort. Fort Prince of Wales had thus yielded without a shot
being fired on either side.</p>

<p>The French admiral lost no time in transporting what guns
he could find to his ships, and replenishing his depleted commissariat
from the well-filled provision stores of the fort.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>La Pérouse was both angry and disappointed at the escape
of the Company's ships and cargoes. One of these ships,
bound for Fort Churchill, he had met in the Bay and immediately
sent a frigate in pursuit. But Captain Christopher,
by the steering of the French frigate, judged rightly that her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
commander knew nothing of the course, and so resorted to
strategy. When night came he furled his sails, as if about to
anchor, a proceeding which the French captain imitated.
When he had anchored, the Company's vessel re-set her sails,
and was soon many leagues distant by the time the French
fleet reached Churchill River.</p>

<p>Possession was followed by license on the part of the
soldiers, and the utter looting of the fort. An attempt was
made, occupying two days, to demolish it; but although
French gunpowder was freely added to the Company's store,
yet the walls resisted their best efforts.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0340" id="im_0340"></a>
<img src="images/im_0340.jpg" width="398" height="296" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Ruins of Fort Prince of Wales.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Of solid masonry, indeed, was Prince of Wales' Fort. The
French artillerymen could only displace the upper rows of the
massive granite stones, dismount its guns, and blow up the
gateway, together with the stone outwork protecting it.</p>

<p>It has been remarked as strange that Hearne, who had
proved his personal bravery in his Arctic travels, should have
shown such a craven front on this occasion to the enemy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, Umfreville, who was himself taken prisoner at the
capture of the fort, declared that he, with others, were disgusted
at the Governor's cowardice. He asserted that the
French were weak and reduced in health after a long sea
voyage, most of them wretchedly clad, and half of the entire
number barefoot.</p>

<p>"I assume, your Honours," wrote John Townsend, "that
had we shown a front to the enemy, our fort would have outlasted
their ammunition, and then they would have been
completely at our mercy."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Hearne
blamed for
surrendering.</p>

<p>The Company was very indignant at the conduct of
Governor Hearne. They demanded the reason
of his not sending a scout overland to apprise
the Governor of York Factory of the enemy's
proximity. To this Hearne replied that he
was given no opportunity, and that any such scout would
have been inevitably seized and slain.</p>

<p>On the 11th of August the French fleet set sail for Port
Nelson and anchored there. One of the Company's ships
was in the harbour at the time, and the captain, perceiving
the approach of three large ships, and scenting danger, put
out to sea in the night. He was instantly pursued by a
frigate, which obviously outsailed him. Whereupon Captain
Fowler tacked and made for the south in the hope of enticing
the Frenchman into shallow water. But her commander was
by no means to become so easy a prey to destruction, and
refused to follow.</p>

<p>On the following day the news was brought to the Governor
that the enemy was landing in fourteen boats, provided with
mortars, cannon, scaling ladders, and about three hundred
men, exclusive of marines.</p>

<p>York Factory at this time was garrisoned by sixty English
and twelve Indians. Its defence consisted of thirteen cannon,
twelve and nine pounders, which formed a half-moon battery
in front; but it being thought probable that the enemy would
arrive in the night and turn these guns against the fort,
they were overturned into the ditch. On the ramparts were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
twelve swivel guns mounted on carriages, and within were
abundance of small arms and ammunition. Besides, a rivulet
of fresh water ran within the stockades; and there were also
thirty head of cattle and as many hogs within the confines of
the fort.</p>

<p>On the 22nd, two Indian scouts were sent out to obtain
intelligence; these returned in about three hours with the
information that, in their judgment, the enemy were less than
a league distant. Indeed they had heard several guns fired
in the neighbourhood of the fort; and at sunset of that day
all could plainly discern a large fire, presumably kindled by
the French about a mile and a half to the west.</p>

<p class="sidenote">French attack
York factory.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the next morning, the enemy appeared
before the gates. "During their approach," says
one of those in the fort at the time, "a most
inviting opportunity offered itself to be revenged
on our invaders by discharging the guns on the ramparts,
which must have done great execution."</p>

<p>Unhappily, the Governor was hardly the man for such an
occasion. He knew nothing of war, and had a wholesome
dread of all armed and equipped soldiery. He trembled so
that he could scarcely stand, and begged the surgeon, "for
God's sake to give him a glass of liquor to steady his nerves."
There being none at hand, he swallowed a tumbler of raw
spirits of wine. This so far infused courage and determination
into his blood, that he peremptorily declared he would
shoot the first man who offered to fire a gun. Dismay took
possession of many of the Company's servants, and the
second in command and the surgeon endeavoured to expostulate.
To avert this, the Governor caught up a white sheet
with his own hand and waved it from a window of the fort.
This was answered by the French officer displaying his pocket
handkerchief.</p>

<p>Under the sanction of this flag of truce, a parley took
place. The Governor was summoned to surrender within
two hours.</p>

<p>But no such time was needed by the Governor; and the
fort was most ingloriously yielded in about ten minutes. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
vain did the council plead that this fort might have withstood
the united efforts of double the number of those by
whom it was assailed in an attack with small arms. In
vain they demonstrated that from the nature of the enemy's
attack by way of Nelson River, they could not use their
mortars or artillery, the ground being very bad and interspersed
with woods, thickets and bogs. The Governor was
resolved to yield the place, and he carried out his intention
much to the astonishment and satisfaction of La Pérouse.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Unwise
surrender.</p>

<p>The unwisdom of the surrender was afterwards made too
apparent. It was made to a half-starved, half-shod body of
Frenchmen, worn out by fatigue and hard labour, not a man
of whom was familiar with the country. It was perceived
also, when it was too late, that the enemy's ships lay at least
twenty miles from the factory, in a boisterous
sea. Consequently, they could not co-operate
with their troops on shore, save with the greatest
difficulty and uncertainty, and if the fort had held out
a few weeks it would have been impossible. The French
troops could have received no supplies but what came from
the ships; and cold, hunger and fatigue were working hourly
in favour of the Company's men.</p>

<p>La Pérouse now issued orders for the fort to be evacuated
and burned, and the Company's people were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>The Company suffered great loss by the capture of York
Factory, which had, as we have seen, remained in their possession
since the Treaty of Utrecht. The whole of the furs
which had not yet been sent on board the ship were destroyed,
as well as a large quantity of stores, implements and appliances
which had been collecting for nearly seventy years.</p>

<p>This expedition had resulted in two cheap conquests for
La Pérouse. But the fortunes of war bade fair to alter the
situation. The Company sent in a bill to the British Government
of many thousands of pounds for failing to protect
their fort on Churchill River; and when peace was proclaimed,
the French plenipotentiary agreed on behalf of his
master to settle this bill.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span></p>

<p>Fort Prince of Wales was never rebuilt. Its ruins stand,
to-day, to mark the most northern fortress on the continent
of North America, scarcely inferior in strength to Louisburg
or to Quebec. "Its site," remarks Dr. Bell, "was admirably
chosen; its design and armament were once perfect; interesting
still as a relic of bygone strife, but useful now only as
a beacon for the harbour it had failed to protect." Although
the French themselves sustained no loss from the English in
their brief campaign against the fort; yet, owing to the
severity of the climate and their own inexperience, they lost
five large boats, a considerable quantity of merchandise and
fifteen soldiers who were drowned in Hays' River after the
surrender of the fort.</p>

</p>

<p class="sidenote">Competition
of the Canadian
traders.</p>

<p>For many years up to 1770, before the traders from Canada
had penetrated their territory, York Factory had annually
sent to London at least 30,000 skins. There were rarely
more than twenty-five men employed in the fort at low wages.
In 1790 the Company maintained nearly one hundred men at
this post, at larger wages, yet the number of skins averaged
only about 20,000 from this and the other posts. The rivalry
daily grew stronger and more bitter. Yet from
what has been seen of the habits and character
of the Canadian bushrangers and peddlers, it is
almost unnecessary to say that the Company's
Scotchmen ingratiated themselves more into the esteem and
confidence of the Indians wherever and whenever the two
rivals met. The advantage of trade, it has been well said, was
on their side&mdash;because their honesty was proven. But there
was another reason for the greater popularity of the Company
amongst the natives, and it was that the principal articles
of their trading goods were of a quality superior to those
imported from Canada.</p>

<p>The extraordinary imprudence and ill-manner of life which
characterized the Montreal traders continually offset the
enterprise and exertions of their employers. Many of these
traders had spent the greater portion of their lives on this
inland service; they were devoid of every social and humane
tie, slaves to the most corrupting vices, more especially
drunkenness. So that it is not strange that they were held
in small esteem by the Indians, who, a choice being free to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
them, finding themselves frequently deceived by specious
promises, were not long in making up their minds with
whom to deal.</p>

<p>"Till the year 1782," says Mackenzie, "the people of
Athabaska sent or carried their furs regularly to Fort
Churchill, and some of them have since that time repaired
farther, notwithstanding they could have provided themselves
with all the necessaries which they required. The difference
of the price set on goods here and at the factory, made it an
object with the Chippewans to undertake a journey of five or
six months, in the course of which they were reduced to the
most painful extremities, and often lost their lives from hunger
and fatigue. At present, however, this traffic is, in a great
measure, discontinued, as they were obliged to expend in
the course of their journey, that very ammunition which was
its most alluring object."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Montreal
merchants
combine.</p>

<p>But the Company was now threatened with a more determined
and judicious warfare by the better class of Canadian
traders. The enterprise had been checked, first by the animosity
of the Indians, and at the same time by the ravages of
the smallpox, but during the winter of 1783-4,
the Montreal merchants resolved, for the better
prosecution of their scheme, to effect a junction
of interests, by forming an association of sixteen
equal shares, without, however, depositing any capital.
The scheme was to be carried out in this way: Each party
was to furnish a proportion of such articles as were necessary
in the trade, while the actual traders, or "wintering partners,"
of these merchants were to receive each a corresponding share
of the profits. To this association was given, on the suggestion
of Joseph Frobisher, the name of the North-West
Company. The chief management of the business was
entrusted to the two Frobishers and Simon McTavish,
another Scotch merchant in Montreal.</p>

<p>In May, 1784, accordingly, Benjamin Frobisher and McTavish
went to the Grand Portage with their credentials from
the other partners in the new undertaking. Here they met
the bulk of the traders and voyageurs, who were delighted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
hear of the new scheme. These entered heartily into the
spirit of the undertaking, and that spring embarked for the
west with the merchandise and provisions brought them, with
a lighter heart than they had known for years, and with a
determination to profit by the disasters of the past. Not all
of the chief traders, it must be said, cast in their lots with the
new company. Two, named Pond and Pangman, opposed it;
and finding a couple of merchants who were willing to furnish
sufficient capital, resolved to strike out for themselves as rivals
to the North-West company. This action occasioned, as
might be expected, great bitterness and disorder. Nevertheless,
it was the means of bringing to light a young Scotchman
from the Isles, whose name will be forever linked with the
North-West. His name was Alexander Mackenzie.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Alexander
Mackenzie.</p>

<p>This young man had been for five years in the counting-house
of Gregory, one of the merchants who had allied
themselves with the two malcontents. It was now decided
that Mackenzie should set out with Pond and Pangman in
their separate trading venture into the distant
Indian country. A more perilous business than
this can scarcely be imagined. Besides the
natural difficulties, the party had to encounter all the fiercest
enmity and opposition of which the adherents of the new
association were capable. It is enough to say that after a
fearful struggle they forced the latter to allow them a participation
in the trade. But the feat which resulted in the
coalition of the two interests in 1787 cost them dear. One of
the partners was killed, another lamed for life, and many of
their voyageurs injured. Yet the establishment thus joined,
and shorn of all rivals save the Great Company, was placed
on a solid basis, and the fur-trade of Canada began to assume
greater proportions than it had yet done under the English
<i>régime</i>. As this North-West concern was finally itself to
merge into the Company of which these chapters are the
history, it will not be unprofitable to glance at its constitution
and methods, particularly as the economic fabric was to be
likewise transferred and adapted to its Hudson's Bay rival.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0348" id="im_0348"></a>
<img src="images/im_0348.jpg" width="317" height="451" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sir Alexander Mackenzie.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">The
North-West
company.</p>

<p>It was then, and continued to be, merely an association of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
merchants agreeing among themselves to carry on the fur-trade
by itself, although many of these merchants plied other
commerce. "It may be said," observes Mackenzie, "to have
been supported entirely on credit; for whether the capital
belonged to the proprietor, or was borrowed, it equally bore
interest, for which the association was annually accountable."
The company comprised twenty shares unequally
divided and amongst the parties concerned.
"Of these a certain proportion was
held by the people who managed the business in
Canada and were styled agents for the company. Their duty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
was to import the necessary goods from England, store them
at their own expense at Montreal, get them made up into
articles suited to the trade, pack and forward them and supply
the cash that might be wanting for the outfits." For all this
they received, besides the profit on their shares, an annual
commission on the business done. A settlement took place
each year, two of the partners going to Grand Portage to
supervise affairs of that growing centre, now outrivalling
Detroit, Michilimackinac and Sault Ste. Marie. The furs
were seen safely to the company's warehouse in Montreal,
where they were stored pending their shipment to England.
This class were denominated agents for the concern.</p>

<p>Then there was the other proprietary class&mdash;the actual
traders, who conducted the expeditions amongst the Indians
and furnished no capital. If they did amass capital by the
trade they could invest it in the company through the agents,
but could never employ it privately. There were several who
from long service and influence who had acquired double
shares and these were permitted to retire from activity, leaving
one of such shares to whichever young man in the service
they chose to nominate, provided always he was approved by
the company. Such successions, we are told, were considered
as due to either seniority or exceptional merit. The retiring
shareholder was relieved from any responsibility concerning
the share he transferred and accounted for it according to the
annual value or rate of the property. Thus the trader who
disposed of his extra share had no pecuniary advantage from
the sale, but only drew a continuous profit from the share
which as a sleeping partner he retained.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Partnership
regulations.</p>

<p>By such means all the younger men who were not provided
for at the inception of the North-West company, or when they
afterwards entered into service, were likely to succeed to the
situation and profits of regular partners in the concern. By
their contract they entered the company's service as articled
clerks for five or seven years. Occasionally they
succeeded to shares before the expiration of
their apprenticeship. None could be admitted
as a partner unless he had first served such apprenticeship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
to the fur-trade, therefore shares were transferable only to
the concern at large. As for the sleeping partner he could
not, of course, be debarred from selling out if he chose,
but if the transaction were not countenanced by the rest,
his name continued to figure in committee, the actual owner
of the share being regarded as merely his agent or attorney.
A vote accompanied every share, two-thirds constituting a
majority.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, was the remarkable constitution of this commercial
body&mdash;a constitution which was in those days wholly
unique. By such regular and equitable methods of providing
for all classes of employees, a zeal and independence was
fostered. Every petty clerk felt himself, as he was, a principal,
and his loyalty and thrift became assured forthwith.</p>

<p>It has been argued, and not unjustly, that such a constitution
was obvious, that no great merit need be ascribed to
its originators, that it was evolved, so to speak, by the
situation itself. The character of the fur-trade at that time
was such, the commerce so hazardous and diffused over so
vast a country, that without that spirit of emulation thus
evoked the new fur company must quickly have resolved
itself into its constituent particles. Nevertheless, shrewdness,
courage and foresight were demanded, and in the persons of
these Canadian Scotchmen were forthcoming.</p>

<p>As for the value of the business in 1788, all the furs, merchandise,
provisions and equipments were worth the sum of
£40,000. This might properly be called the stock of the
Company, for, as Mackenzie, who was now one of its traders,
remarked, it included, within the gross expenditure for that
year, the amount of the property unexpended, which having
been appropriated for that year's adventure, was carried on to
the account of the next season.</p>

<p>So greatly did the new Company flourish that the gross
amount of the adventure ten years later, was close upon
£125,000. But in that year, 1798, a change was to occur
which will be dealt with in another chapter.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Mackenzie's
expedition to
the Arctic.</p>

<p>In 1789 Mackenzie felt the time ripe to prosecute a journey
towards which his mind had long been directed&mdash;that journey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
overland to the Pacific, in which Verandrye, as we have seen,
had failed through the hand of death. His commercial
associates by no means relished the
enterprise; but Mackenzie's power and influence
had now grown considerable, and he found
means this year to carry out his wish. On the 3rd of June,
1789, Mackenzie set out from Fort Chipewyan, at the head of
Athabaska Lake, a station nearly midway between Hudson's
Bay and the Pacific.</p>

<p>The young explorer had served here for eight years, and
was familiar with the difficulties he had to face, as well as
aware of the best methods of overcoming them. Taking with
him four canoes, he embarked a German and four Canadians
with their wives in the first. The second canoe was occupied
by a northern Indian, called English Chief, who had been
a follower of Matonabee, Hearne's chief guide and counsellor.
This worthy was accompanied by his two wives. The third
was taken up by two sturdy young savages, who served in the
double capacity of hunters and interpreters; whilst the fourth
was laden with provisions, clothing, ammunition, and various
articles designed as presents to the Indians. This canoe was
in charge of one of the North-West concern's clerks, named
La Roux.</p>

<p>In such fashion and in such numbers did Mackenzie's party
set forth from Fort Chipewyan. By the 4th of June they
reached Slave River, which connects the Athabasca and Slave
Lakes in a course of about 170 miles; on the 9th of the same
month they sighted Slave Lake itself. During this part of the
journey they had suffered no other inconvenience than those
arising from the attacks of the mosquitoes during the heat of
the day and the excessive cold, which characterizes the nights
in that country, especially in the hours near dawn.</p>

<p>Skirting the shore they came to a lodge of Red Knife
Indians, so called from their use of copper knives. One
of these natives offered to conduct Mackenzie to the mouth
of that river which was the object of his search, as the
Coppermine had been of Hearne's. Unhappily, so numerous
were the impediments encountered from drift ice, contrary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
winds, and the ignorance of their guide (whom English Chief
threatened to murder for his incompetence), that it was the
29th of the month before they embarked upon the stream
which to-day bears the name of the leader of the party who
then first ascended it.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Journey down
the Mackenzie
River.</p>

<p>On quitting the lake, the Mackenzie River was found to
take its course to the westward, becoming gradually narrower
for twenty-four miles, till it dwindled to a stream half a mile
wide, having a strong current and a depth of three and a half
fathoms. A stiff breeze from the eastward now drove them
on at a great speed, and after a run of ten miles the channel
widened gradually until it assumed the appearance of a small
lake. The guide confessed that this was the limit of his
acquaintance with the river. Soon afterwards they came in
sight of the chain of Horn Mountains, bearing north-west,
and experienced some difficulty in resuming the channel of
the river. The party continued the journey for five days with
no interruption. On July 6th they observed several columns
of smoke on the north bank and on landing discovered
an encampment of five families of Slave and
Dog-ribbed Indians, who, on the first appearance
of the white men, fled in consternation
to the woods. English Chief, however, called
after them, in a tongue they understood, and they, though
reluctantly, responded to his entreaties to return, especially
when they were accompanied by offers of gifts. The distribution
of a few beads, rings and knives, with a supply of
grog, soon reconciled them to the strangers. But the travellers
were somewhat appalled to learn from these Indians of
the rigours of the journey which awaited them. These
asserted that it would require several winters to reach the sea,
and that old age would inevitably overtake the party before
their return. Demons of terrible shape and malevolent disposition
were stated to have their dwellings in the rock caves
which lined the river's brim, and these were ready to devour
the hardy spirits who should dare continue their journey past
them. This information Mackenzie and his party endeavoured
to receive with equanimity; they staggered more at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
the narrative of two impassable falls which were said to
exist about thirty days march from where they then were.</p>

<p>But although the effect of these tales on the leader of the
expedition was not great, his Indians, already weary of travelling,
drank all in with willing ears. They could hardly be
induced to continue the journey. When their scruples were
overcome, one of the Dog-ribbed Indians was persuaded by
the present of a kettle, an axe, and some other articles, to
accompany them as guide. But, alas, when the hour for
embarkation came, his love of home overbore all other considerations,
and his attempt to escape was only frustrated by
actually forcing him on board.</p>

<p>Continuing their journey, they passed the Great Bear Lake
River, and steering through numerous islands came in sight
of a ridge of snowy mountains, frequented, according to their
guide, by herds of bears and small white buffalo. The banks
of the river were seen to be pretty thickly peopled with
natives, whose timidity was soon overcome by small gifts.
From these Indians was procured a seasonable supply of
hares, partridges, fish and reindeer. The same stories of
spirits or manitous which haunted the stream, and of fearful
rapids which would dash the canoes in pieces, were repeated
by these tribes. This time they had a real effect. The guide,
during a storm of thunder and lightning, decamped in the
night, and no doubt fled for home as rapidly as his legs, or
improvised canoe, could carry him. No great difficulty,
however, was experienced in procuring a substitute, and after
a short sail the party approached an encampment of Indians,
whose brawny figures, healthy appearance, and cleanliness
were a great improvement on the other tribes they had seen.
From these Mackenzie learnt that he must sleep ten nights
before arriving at the sea. In three nights, he was told, he
would meet with Esquimaux, with whom they had been at
war, but were now at peace.</p>

<p>It was evident that none in these parts had ever heard
the sound of fire-arms for, when one of Mackenzie's men
discharged his fowling-piece, the utmost terror took possession
of them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span></p>

<p>When this intrepid pioneer through the lands of the
Hudson's Bay Company had reached a latitude of 67° 47´, a
great range of snowy mountains burst into view. Mackenzie,
by this time, was convinced that the waters on which the four
frail barks were gliding must flow into the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>When within a few days of accomplishing the great object
of the journey, the attendant Indians sunk into a fit of despondency
and were reluctant to proceed. The new guide
pleaded his ignorance of the region, as he had never before
penetrated to what he and his fellows termed the Benahulla
Toe.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Mackenzie, thereupon, assured them all that he would
return if it were not reached in seven days, and so prevailed
on them to continue the journey.</p>

<p>The nights were now illumined by a blazing sun and everything
denoted the proximity of the sea. On landing at a
deserted Esquimaux encampment, several pieces of whalebone
were observed; also a place where train-oil had been
spilt. Signs of vegetation grew rarer and rarer.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The explorer
reaches the
Arctic.</p>

<p>On the 12th of July the explorer reached what appears to
have been an arm of the Arctic Sea. It was quite open to
the westward, and by an observation the latitude was found
to be 69°. All before them, as far as they could see, was a
vast stretch of ice. They continued their course
with difficulty fifteen miles to the western-most
extremity of a high island, and then
it was found impossible to proceed farther.
Many other islands were seen to the eastward; but though
they came to a grave, on which lay a bow, a paddle and a
spear, they met no living human beings in those Arctic solitudes.
The red fox and the reindeer, flocks of beautiful
plover, some venerable white owls, and several large white
gulls were the only natives.</p>

<p>But Mackenzie knew he had triumphed; for he had, as he
stood on the promontory of Whale Island, caught sight of a
shoal of those marine night monsters from whom the island
then received its name. Before returning, Mackenzie caused a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
post to be erected close to the tents, upon which the traveller
engraved the latitude of the spot, his own name, the number
of persons accompanying him, and the time they spent on the
island.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Portage.</span></p>
</div>

<p>On the 16th of July they set out on their long journey to
the fort. On the 21st, the sun, which for some time had
never set, descended below the horizon, and on that day they
were joined by eleven of the natives. These represented
their tribe as numerous, and perpetually at war with the
Esquimaux, who had broken a treaty into which they had
seduced the Indians and had massacred many of them. On
one occasion an Indian of a strange tribe beyond the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
mountains to the west endeavoured to draw for Mackenzie a
map of that distant country with a stick upon the sand. It
was a rude production, but gave the explorer an idea. The
savage traced out a long point of land between two rivers.
This isthmus he represented as running into the great lake,
at the extremity of which, as he had been told by Indians of
other nations, there was built a Benahulla Couin, or White
Man's Fort.</p>

<p>"This," says Mackenzie, "I took to be Oonalaska Fort, and
consequently the river to the west to be Cook's River, and
that the body of water or sea into which the river discharges
itself at Whale Island communicated with Norton Sound."</p>

<p>Mackenzie in vain endeavoured to procure a guide across
the mountains; the natives refused to accompany him. On
the 12th of September the party arrived in safety at Fort
Chippewyan, having been absent one hundred and two days.</p>

<p>Taken in connection with Hearne's journey, this expedition
was of great importance as establishing the fact of an Arctic
sea of wide extent to the north of the continent. It seemed
probable, also, that this sea formed its continuous boundary.</p>

<p>But the greater expedition of this intrepid fur-trader was
yet to be undertaken. His object this time was to ascend
the Peace River, which rises in the Rocky Mountains, and
crossing these to penetrate to that unknown stream which he
had sought in vain during his former journey. This river, he
conjectured, must communicate with the ocean; and finding
it, he must be borne along to the Pacific.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Mackenzie
sets out for
the Pacific.</p>

<p>The explorer set out, accordingly, from Fort Chippewyan
on the 10th of October, 1792, pushing on to the remotest
trading post, where he spent the winter in a traffic for furs
with the Beaver and Rocky Indians. When he had
despatched six canoes to Chippewyan with the cargo he had
collected, he engaged hunters and interpreters,
built a huge canoe and set out for the Pacific.
This canoe, it may be mentioned, was twenty-five
feet long within, exclusive of the curves
of stem and stern, twenty-six inches hold and four feet
nine inches beam. At the same time it was so light that two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
men could carry it three or four miles, if necessity arose,
without stopping to rest. In such a slender craft they not
only stowed away their provisions, presents, arms, ammunition
and baggage to the weight of three thousand pounds,
but found room for Mackenzie, seven white companions and
two Indians. Up to the 21st of May the party encountered
a series of such difficulties and hardships that all save the
leader himself were disheartened at the prospect. The river
being broken by frequent cascades and dangerous rapids, it
was very often necessary to carry the canoe and baggage until
the voyage could be resumed in safety; and on their nearer
approach to the Rocky Mountains the stream, hemmed in
between stupendous rocks, presented a continuance of fearful
torrents and huge cataracts. The party began to murmur
audibly; and, at last, progress came to a standstill. In truth,
there was some reason for this irresolution; further progress
by water was impossible and they could only advance over a
mountain whose sides were broken by sharp, jagged rocks
and thickly covered with wood. Mackenzie despatched a
reconnoitring party, with orders to ascend the mountain and
proceed in a straight course from its summit, keeping the
line of the river until they could ascertain if it was practicable
to resume navigation.</p>

<p>While this party was gone on its quest, the canoe was
repaired, and Mackenzie busied himself in taking an altitude
which showed the latitude to be 56° 8'. By sunset the scouts
had severally returned, each having taken different routes.
They had penetrated through thick woods, ascended hills and
dived into valleys, passed the rapids, and agreed, that though
the difficulties by land were appalling, this was the only practicable
course. Unattractive as was the prospect, the spirits
of the party rose as night closed in. Their troubles were
forgotten in a repast of wild rice sweetened with sugar; the
usual evening regale of rum renewed their courage, and followed
by a night's rest, they entered upon the journey next
day with cheerfulness and vigour.</p>

<p>It is not to the purpose here to relate all that befell Mackenzie
on this memorable voyage, but, after many vicissitudes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
towards the close of June he reached the spot where the
party were to strike off across the country.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Journey in
the mountain.</p>

<p>"We carried on our back," says Mackenzie, "four bags and
a half of pemmican, weighing from eighty-five to ninety-five
pounds each, a case with the instruments, a parcel of goods
for presents weighing ninety pounds, and a parcel containing
ammunition of the same weight; each of the
Canadians had a burden of about ninety pounds,
with a gun and ammunition, whilst the Indians
had about forty-five pounds weight of pemmican, besides their
gun&mdash;an obligation with which, owing to their having been
treated with too much indulgence, they expressed themselves
much dissatisfied. My own load, and that of Mr. Mackay,
consisted of twenty-two pounds of pemmican, some rice, sugar,
and other small articles, amounting to about seventy pounds,
besides our arms and ammunition. The tube of my telescope
was also slung across my shoulder, and owing to the low state
of our provisions, it was determined that we should content
ourselves with two meals a day."</p>

<p>About the middle of July Mackenzie encountered a chief
who had, ten years before, in a voyage by sea, met with two
large vessels full of white men, the first he had ever seen and
by whom he was kindly received. The explorer very plausibly
conjectured that these were the ships of Captain Cook. Thus
the names of two of the world's great explorers were, by that
episode, conjoined.</p>

<p>The navigation of the river, although interrupted by rapids
and cascades, was continued until the 23rd, when the party
reached its mouth. Here the river was found to discharge
itself by various smaller channels into the Pacific.</p>

<p>The memorable journey was now finished, and its purpose
completed. In large characters, upon the surface of a rock
under whose shelter the party had slept, their leader painted
this simple memorial:</p>

<p>"Alexander Mackenzie, from Canada by land the 22nd of
July, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three."</p>

<p>Such was the inscription written with vermilion, at which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
doubtless the simple aboriginal tribes came to marvel before
it was washed away by the elements. But its purport was
conveyed to England in another and more abiding character,
which yet will not outlast the memory of the achievement.
Mackenzie and his followers had paved the way; almost
despite itself the Company must take possession, before long,
of its own; although much had arisen which rendered the task
less easy than if it had been undertaken immediately on the
conquest, thirty years before.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Turner's
exploration.</p>

<p>The news of Mackenzie's journeys reaching London considerably
perturbed the Honourable Adventurers and undeniably
diminished their prestige. It was not that the Company did
not wish to pursue discovery and bring about a knowledge of
the vast unknown regions which appertained to it under the
charter; it was for a long time impracticable. In 1785 it
had sent out orders to continue the exploration of the west,
begun by Hearne. A man had been despatched in accordance
with these instructions, but his courage, or his endurance,
had failed him, and he returned to Cumberland House
without having accomplished anything of note. For the five
or six years ensuing, the reports of the meetings of the
Company are sufficient testimony to the desire of the members
to take an active part in seeking trade with unknown
tribes. But to effect this, men were necessary; and men of
the required character were not immediately forthcoming.
It was not till 1791 that, after an animated correspondence
with the Colonial Office, a person was suggested for the
enterprise who seemed to possess the equipment adequate to
the task. This was Turner, who sought a career
as an astronomer, and with him went Ross, one
of the Company's clerks. Both were badly
furnished for an expedition of this kind, and taking counsel
among themselves, came to the conclusion that as they had to
make their way through parts unknown to the Hudson's Bay
servants, it would be as well to seek the assistance of the
Northmen as well. From Alexander Mackenzie, Turner
obtained a letter to the factor in charge of Fort Chippewyan,
instructing him to offer the explorers every facility and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
courtesy; and indeed so well were Turner and his companion
treated at this post that they passed the winter there. The
result of this expedition went to show that Lake Athabasca,
instead of being situated in proximity to the Pacific, was
really distant nearly a thousand miles.</p>

<p>There were men enough for the work in hand if the Company
had only availed themselves of them. At the very
moment when Mackenzie was making his voyages, a youth
was finishing his education at the Charter House who had all
the cleverness, force and intrepidity for the task that all desired
to see accomplished. His name was David Thompson. The
time having arrived when this youth should choose a career,
his inclination turned to travel in the unknown quarters of the
globe, and hoping that adventure of some sort would transpire
for him in the north-west of the New World, he signed as
one of the clerks of the Company, and set sail in 1794 for
Fort Churchill. Arriving here, he found himself "cribbed,
cabined and confined." Governor Colen and himself were
little to their mutual liking, and still less of the same mind,
as Thompson had an ardent, energetic temperament, and
was with difficulty controlled. Yet during the summer of
1795, by reason of continuous pleadings, he obtained permission
to set out on a tour to the west, and with an
escort of one white clerk, an Irishman, and two Indians,
he travelled to Athabasca, surveying the country as he
went along.</p>

<p class="sidenote">David
Thompson.</p>

<p>On his return from Athabasca, Thompson's term of service
had expired, and he was encouraged to apply for employment
with the Northmen. They desired to learn the position
of their trading houses, chiefly with respect to
the 49th parallel of latitude, which had become,
since the treaty of 1792 with America, the
boundary line between the possessions of the two countries.
For several years Thompson continued in the service of the
Company's rivals, surveying a considerable territory and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
drawing up charts and maps, which were sent to the partners
at Fort William.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>After Thompson came Simon Fraser and John Stuart, the
names of both of whom are perpetuated in the rivers bearing
their names to-day. Fraser is described by one of his
associates as "an illiterate, ill-bred, fault-finding man, of
jealous disposition, but ambitious and energetic, with
considerable conscience, and in the main holding to honest
convictions."</p>

<p>Both these men bore a chief share in establishing trading
posts on the other side of the Rocky Mountains, which are
now associated with the Hudson's Bay Company.</p>

</p>

<p>When Mackenzie, in July, 1793, reached the Pacific by land
from the east, he had been preceded by sea only three years
by Captain George Vancouver, the discoverer of the British
Columbian coast. The same year Gray, sailing from Boston
in 1790, entered the Columbia River farther south. But the
title of Muscovy to the northern coasts had already been
made good by several Russians since Bering's time, and the
Company's charter secured to them the lands drained by the
Fraser, Mackenzie, and Peace rivers, to the west.</p>

<p class="sidenote">La Pérouse
in the
Pacific.</p>

<p>So little, however, was the Russian title recognized for some
time, that when this unfortunate expedition of La Pérouse,
with the frigates <i>Boussole</i> and <i>Astralabe</i>, stopped on this coast
in 1787, that doughty destroyer of York and Prince of Wales'
Forts did not hesitate to consider the friendly harbour in
latitude 58° 36' as open to permanent occupation. Describing
this harbour, which he named Port des François,
he says that nature seemed to have created at
this extremity of the world a port like that of
Toulon, but vaster in plan and accommodation;
and then, considering that it had never been discovered
before, that it was situated thirty-three leagues north-west of
Remedios, the limit of Spanish navigation, about two hundred
and eighty-four leagues from Nootka, and one hundred
leagues from Prince William Sound. The mariner records
his judgment that "if the French Government had any project
of a factory on this coast no nation could have the
slightest right to oppose it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a></span>

</div>

<p>Thus was Russia to be coolly dislodged by the French!
There is little doubt but that the Company, judging by its
declarations in committee some years afterwards, would have
had something to say in the matter. But La Pérouse and his
frigates sailed farther on in their voyage and never returned
to France. Their fate for a generation remained unknown,
until their shipwrecked hulls were accidentally found on a
desert island in the South Pacific. The unfinished journal of
this zealous admiral had, however, in the meantime been sent
by him overland by way of Kamschatka and Siberia to
France, where it was published by decree of the National
Assembly, thus making known his supposed discovery and his
aspirations.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Spanish
claims.</p>

<p>Spain also had been a claimant. In 1775 Bodega, a
Spanish navigator, seeking new opportunities to plant the
Spanish flag, reached a parallel of 58° on this coast, not far
from Sitka; but this supposed discovery was not followed by
any immediate assertion of dominion. The universal aspiration
of Spain had embraced this whole region at a much
earlier day, and shortly after the return of Bodega another
enterprise was equipped to verify the larger claim, being
nothing less than the original title as discoverer
of the straits between America and
Asia, and of the conterminous continent
under the name of Anian. Indeed, a Spanish document
appeared, which caused a considerable fluttering of hearts
amongst the Adventurers, entitled "Relation of the Discovery
of the Strait of Anian made by me, Captain Lorenzo Ferren
Maldonado," purporting to be written at the time, although
it did not see the light until 1781, when it immediately
became the subject of a memoir before the French Academy.
This narrative of Maldonado has long since taken its place
with that of the celebrated Munchausen.</p>

<p>The whole fantastic episode of Anian's Straits is worthy
of mention in a history of the Company and its lands. There
is no doubt of the existence of early maps bearing straits of
that name to the north. On an interesting map by Zoltieri,
bearing the date of 1566, without latitude or longitude, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
western coast of the continent is here delineated with straits
separating it from Asia, not unlike Bering's Straits in outline
and with the name in Italian, Stretto di Anian; and towards
the south the coast possesses a certain conformity to that
which we now know. Below the straits is an indentation
corresponding to Bristol Bay; then a peninsula somewhat
broader than Alaska, which is continued in an elbow of the
coast; lower down appear three islands, not unlike Sitka,
Queen Charlotte and Vancouver; and lastly, to the south
appears the peninsula of Lower California. After a time
maps began to record the Straits of Anian; but the substantial
conformity of the early delineation with the reality has
always been somewhat of a mystery.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>The foundation of the story of Anian is said to lie in the
voyage of the Portuguese navigator, Caspar de Cortereal, in
1500-1505, who, on reaching Hudson's Bay in quest of a
passage to India, imagined he had found it, naming his
discovery "in honour of two brothers who accompanied
him."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Russians on
the west
coast.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Russian hunters and traders from Okhotsk were
extending their expedition from the north-east coast of
Siberia to the north-west coast of North America. A Russian
Government expedition started from Okhotsk in 1790, under
the command of Captain Billings, an Englishman in the
Russian service, and to Captain Taryteheff, one
of the members, are due important researches
on the hydrography and ethnology of these
countries. The first attempt at permanent settlement
was due to three Russian traders, Shelekoff and the
two Golikoffs, who fitted out two or three vessels to be sent
to "the land of Alaska, also called America; to islands
known or unknown, for the purpose of trading in furs; of
exploring the country and entering into relations with the
inhabitants." Their first expedition started in 1781, and the
first settlement was founded on the Island of Kodiak. The
authority of the Russian Government was thus established
on this and the adjacent islands. In 1790, Shelekoff, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
residing in Irkoutsk, sent out a merchant named Baranoff to
govern the new colony.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Thus the knowledge that they were being pressed in on
opposite sides by the Canadian traders on the south and east,
and by Russians on the north and west, reached the Company
at the same time. As a matter of fact, the knowledge of Baranoff's
enterprise and the energy with which it was being
prosecuted did not come before the committee until October,
1794; and it was in that very month that the report of Mackenzie's
journey reached them.</p>

<p>The next few years were devoted to devising and considering
schemes to counteract these two growing competitors&mdash;to
oppose the further progress of the Russians on the one hand,
and to combat the North-Westers on the other.</p>

<p>For twenty-seven years Baranoff continued to be the controlling
mind of the new Russian trading enterprise. Shelekoff
died in 1795; and his widow continued the business, and
upon combining with the Milnikoff Company it increased
gradually in wealth. The charter of these joint enterprises,
to which the name of the Russian-American Fur Company
was given, was signed in August, 1798, and confirmed at St.
Petersburg in 1799. That year witnessed the settlement of
New Archangel, on the island of Sitka.</p>

<p>The consequences of this increased output were not, however,
felt in the fur-markets at Leipsic. Europe was convulsed by
war, and Napoleon had laid an embargo on British goods.
The furs, therefore, accumulated for several years in the stores
of the Hudson's Bay Company without finding a mart.</p>

<p>From 1787 to 1817, for only a portion of which time the
Russian Company existed, the Unalaska district yielded
upwards of 2,500,000 seal skins alone. The number of other
skins reported at times was prodigious.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span></p>

<p>But the time had not come for the Company to actively
assert itself in opposition to the Russians.</p>

<p>It was paying dearly now for its short-sightedness in not
availing itself of the opportunities afforded by the conquest
of Canada to penetrate into its chartered domain. In the
second year of the century the Honourable Adventurers had
been obliged to borrow £20,000 from the Bank of England,
hoping that the cessation of war in Europe, and the quarrels
of the rival Montreal traders in North America, would permit
the Company to regain the advantage it had lost. For in
the autumn of 1798 the Company had received advices that
its prosperous Canadian rival had taken a new step in the
conduct of its affairs.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rival factions
in the
North-West
Company.</p>

<p>Difficulties and dissensions had begun to breed in the
ranks of the Northmen. A few disaffected spirits spoke of
secession and carried their intentions into effect, but the
stronger partners were reluctant to break up an alliance
which had proved so prosperous. But in the closing year,
but one of the century, the situation became intolerable and
when the partners met, as was their custom at the Grand
Portage, Mackenzie bluntly told his associates that he had
resolved to quit the Company. He was led to this decision
by a personal quarrel between himself and Simon McTavish,
the chief of the North-West Company. Opposing factions
sprang into being, attaching themselves to both Mackenzie
and McTavish, the latter of whom strongly resented the way
in which he was treated at the annual meeting by the partisans
of the former, and each now determined to
take his course thenceforward untrammelled by
the other. Mackenzie went to England, where
he published an account of his travels in the
north-west and obtained the honour of knighthood, and in
1801 returned to Canada. Here his friends flocked about
him, and there saw the light of a new organization, officially
entitled the New North-West Company, or Sir Alexander
Mackenzie &amp; Co., but more popularly as the X. Y. Co. The
two rival Canadian associations now put forth all their
strength to establish their commerce in the unknown and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
unfrequented regions. One of the old North-West employees,
Livingston, who had already, in 1796, established a post
nearly 100 miles north of Slave Lake, undertook to carry the
trade still farther north. But this he was never destined to
accomplish. A few days out on this journey he was confronted
by the aborigines, who slew him and his companions.
An expedition to the Bow River, however, was more successful,
and in the midst of many hostile Indians a trading post
was established there. Other proofs of enterprise on the
part of McTavish and his associates were not wanting.</p>

<p>The dissensions between the two companies so far do not
appear to have had a prejudicial effect on the traffic, for on
the 30th October, 1802, Lieutenant Governor Milnes, in a
dispatch to Lord Hobart,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> gives an account of the flourishing
state of the fur-trade which so far, he says, from diminishing,
appears to increase. New tracts of country had been visited
by the merchants employed in this traffic, which had furnished
new sources of supply, a large proportion of the furs taken in
the North-West being brought to Quebec for shipment.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>But, perhaps, a policy the most daring was pursued with
regard to the Hudson's Bay Company. It was not expected
that either McTavish and his allies, or the X. Y. concern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
would long be content to forego the glory and profit attendant
upon warfare at close quarters with the Chartered Company.</p>

<p>"What is there in their charter," they asked themselves,
"which gives them benefits we cannot enjoy? We shall see."</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Northmen
at Hudson's
Bay.</p>

<p>They provided for a most effectual demonstration. In the
spring of 1803, they sent the <i>Beaver</i>, a vessel of one hundred
and fifty tons, to Hudson's Bay, with instructions to
exploit commerce under the very guns of the Company's
forts. Hardly had the <i>Beaver</i> got under way than an overland
expedition was sent by the old French trading route of
Lakes St. Jean and Mistassini, to the same quarter. The
result was the construction of two posts, one on Charlton
Island, and the other at the mouth of Moose River. The
astonishment of the Company's servants can be imagined,
when upon looking out one fine morning, they
beheld a band of swarthy half-breeds, captained
by Orkneymen, rearing premises adjacent to
their own, and bidding defiance to the ancient
charter of the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company. They
were told by their superiors not to be alarmed; the
scheme of their rivals would not succeed any more than had
those of the Quebec companies who a century before had
sought to penetrate overland to the Bay. The company could
always undersell them then; and it could now, and did. The
confidence of the factors was justified, and the Indians merely
smiled at the Northmen and their goods, bidding them return
to their country, or betake themselves to the west, where the
tribes were ignorant and knew not the value of things. So,
after a season or two, the North-West concern abandoned
Moose River and Charlton Island, and sought other and more
fruitful fields in the west.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Fishery
and Fur
Company.</p>

<p>Mackenzie himself was in London actively engaged in
promoting a scheme of his own. He sought to get the British
Government to constrain the Hudson's Bay Company to
grant licenses to a company of British merchants, to be
established in London under the name of "The Fishery and
Fur Company," which company, for the purpose of combining
the fishery in the Pacific with the fur trade of the interior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
from the east to the west coasts of the Continent of North
America, would at once "equip whalers in England, and by
means of the establishments already made and in activity
at Montreal on the east and advanced posts and trading
houses in the interior towards the west coast, to which they
might extend it and where other establishments to be made at
King George Sound, Nootka Island, under the protection of
the Supreme Government, and on the River Columbia and at
Sea Otter Harbour under the protection of the subordinate
Government of these places, would open and establish a commercial
communication through the Continent of North
America between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to the
incalculable advantage and furtherance both of
the Pacific Fishery of America and American
Fur Trade of Great Britain, in part directly and
in part indirectly, through the channel of the
possessions and factories of the East India Company in
China," etc., "it being perfectly understood that none of these
maritime or inland establishments shall be made on territory
in the possession of any other European nation, nor within
the limits of the United States of North America or of the
Hudson's Bay Company." The scheme, however, failed.</p>

<p>The death of McTavish, in 1804, brought about a reunion
of the two rival factions, and the North-West Company became
stronger than ever. They imitated the Chartered Company in
establishing several of their members in London as agents,
who purchased the necessary merchandise and saw it safely
shipped, besides attending to the fur imports and other
regular business of the concern.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Coalition of
the North-West
and X. Y.
Companies.</p>

<p>After the coalition of the old North-West and the X. Y.
concern, and the consequent suppression of all
private adventurers in Canada, the only rival of
the Northmen in the Uplands was the Hudson's
Bay Company. It was alleged that thenceforward
the ferocious spirit which had been
fostered among the clerks and servants of the two companies
by six years of continual violence was all turned against the
Company. It was said that not only was a systematic plan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
formed for driving their traders out of all valuable beaver
companies, but that hopes were entertained of reducing
the Company to so low an ebb as in time to induce them
to make over their chartered rights to their commercial rival.
With this intent, a series of aggressive acts was now begun
and carried on against the servants of the Company.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0373" id="im_0373"></a>
<img src="images/im_0373.jpg" width="400" height="403" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Rival Traders.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The Hudson's Bay Company had witnessed the encroachment
of the traders, first French, then English, as well as the
establishment and growth of the North-West association,
without taking any active steps to forcibly restrain them.
Many years was the competition carried on without any
violent breach of the peace on either side. Oftentimes indeed
did the rival traders meet in the wilderness at a deserted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
camp, or at some remote portage, but they bore no personal
enmity in their hearts. They shook hands, smoked, broke
meat together, and parted&mdash;one with his beaver skins to the
east, the other to the north&mdash;to Cumberland or York Factory.
Doubtless the North-West concern at the beginning of the
century possessed a powerful advantage in the system of
profits and deserved promotion, while the Company's servants,
unstimulated by any hope of additional reward or certain
promotion, was calculated to foster apathy, rather than zeal.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Murder of
Labau.</p>

<p>It was claimed by the Company that the Northmen
employed for their purposes men of the most abandoned
character who, as Sir Alexander Mackenzie expressed it,
"considered the command of their employer as binding on
them, and however wrong or irregular the transaction the
responsibility rested with the principal who directed them."
One of the first instances of collision occurred in the year
1800. In that year Frederick Schultz, a clerk of the old
Company, commanded a post near Nepigon. Amongst his
men was a young lad about nineteen years of age named
Labau, who understood English, and had in the course of the
preceding winter become intimate with the servants of the
Hudson's Bay Company, who occupied a post near the same
place. Labau was attracted to the Company's service and,
when the traders on both sides were preparing to leave their
wintering ground, resolved to go down to York Factory.
Intelligence of this having reached Schultz, he sent his interpreter
to order Labau to return to his duty, accompanied by
a reminder that he was in debt to the North-West Company.
The young man responded by offering to remit the money he
owed the Company, but declared that he would not remain
any longer in its service. This answer being reported to
Schultz he vehemently declared that if the scoundrel would
not come back willingly he would know what to do with him.
The doughty Northman took his dagger, carefully whetted it,
and having dressed himself in his best attire, went over to the
Hudson's Bay post. Here he found Labau, and asked him in
a furious tone whether he would come with him. The young
man, being intimidated, faltered out an affirmative, but watching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
his opportunity sought to make his escape out of the
room, but Schultz was too quick for him. He drew his
dagger and aimed a blow which Labau tried in
vain to avoid. He was stabbed in the loin, and
expired the same evening. After this exploit,
when Schultz returned to the assembly of the Northmen at
the Grand Portage, he met with an indifferent reception,
Labau being rather popular amongst his fellow-servants. It
was, therefore, not thought advisable to employ Schultz any
longer in that quarter, although this was the only notice
taken of the murder. The murderer came down in the canoes
of the North-West concern to Montreal, where he remained at
large and unnoticed for months. He was afterwards taken
into the service of the Company, employed in a different
region, and after several years settled down undisturbed in
Lower Canada.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0375" id="im_0375"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">York Factory.</span><br />
(<i>From an old print.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>There can be no doubt that much of the success of the
Northmen was due to the indiscriminate manner in which
they extirpated the animals in the country, destroying all
without distinction, whether young or old, in season or out of
season. The miserable natives, over-awed by the preparation
and power of the strangers, and dreading the resentment of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
Northmen, witnessed this destruction without daring to resist,
although they complained bitterly that their country was
wasted as if it had been overrun by fire. It is well known
that the best season for hunting all the fur-bearing animals
is the winter. The fur in summer is universally of inferior
quality, and this, too, is the season when wild animals rear
their young. For both these reasons it seemed desirable that
the hunting should be suspended during the summer months,
and this was effectually procured when all the best hunters,
all the young and active men of the Indian tribes, were
engaged in a distant excursion. There was consequently a
material advantage in requiring them to leave their hunting
grounds in summer, and come to the factories on the coast for
a supply of European goods. While this was the practice, no
furs were brought from home but those of prime quality, and
as the beaver and other valuable fur-bearing animals were
protected from injury during the most critical time of the year,
the breed was preserved, and the supply was plentiful. But
when the traders came to the interior, there to remain throughout
the year, the Indians were tempted to conceal their hunts
through the season. They were too improvident to abstain
from killing the breeding animals or their young. The cub
was destroyed with the full-grown beaver, and the consequence
might readily have been foreseen. These valuable
animals, formerly so numerous, rapidly approached the
point of complete extermination. It was observed that the
district in which they once abounded, and from which large
supplies were formerly obtained, soon came to produce few
or none.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Collision at
Big Fall.</p>

<p>In autumn, 1806, John Crear, a trader in the service of the
Hudson's Bay Company (also on the establishment of Albany
Factory), occupied a post at a place called Big Fall, near Lake
Winipic. One evening a party of Canadians in two canoes,
commanded by Mr. Alexander MacDonnell, then a clerk of
the North-West Company, arrived, and encamped at a short
distance. On the following morning four of Crear's men set
out for their fishing grounds, about a mile off, immediately
after which Mr. MacDonnell came to the house with his men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
and charging Crear with having traded furs with an Indian
who was indebted to the North-West concern,
insisted on these furs being given up to him.
On Crear's refusal, MacDonnell's men broke
open the warehouse door. William Plowman, the only servant
that remained with Crear, attempted to prevent them
from entering; but one of the Canadians knocked him down,
while another presented a gun at Crear himself. Although
MacDonnell prevented him from firing, the Canadian struck
Crear in the eye with the butt end of his gun, which covered
his face with blood and felled him to the ground. Mr. MacDonnell
himself stabbed Plowman in the arm with a dagger,
and gave him a dangerous wound. The Canadians then rifled
the warehouse; the furs, being taken in summer, were of little
value; but they carried off two bags of flour, a quantity of
salt pork and beef, and some dried venison, and also took
away a new canoe belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company.
In the following February MacDonnell sent one of his junior
clerks with a party of men, who again attacked Crear's house,
overpowered him, beat him and his men in the most brutal
manner, and carried away a great number of valuable furs.
They also obliged Crear to sign a paper acknowledging that
he had given up the furs voluntarily, which they extorted with
threats of instant death if he should refuse. Mr. Alexander
MacDonnell had lately been promoted to the station of a
partner in the North-West concern.</p>

<p>In the year 1806, Mr. Fidler was sent with a party of
eighteen men from Churchill Factory, to establish a trading
post at Isle a la Crosse, near the borders of the Athabasca
country, but within the territories of the Hudson's Bay
Company. He remained there for two years, sending a
detachment of his people to Green Lake and Beaver River.
During the first winter he had some success, but afterwards
he was effectually obstructed. On many former occasions
the officers of the Hudson's Bay Company had attempted to
establish a trade in this place, which is in the centre of a
country abounding in beaver, but they had always been
obliged to renounce the attempt. The methods used with
Mr. Fidler may explain the causes of this failure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. John MacDonnell had been Mr. Fidler's competitor
during the early part of the winter, but (not being inclined to
set all principles of law and justice at defiance) was removed
and relieved, first by Mr. Robert Henry, and then by Mr.
John Duncan Campbell. The North-West concern having
been established for many years at Isle a la Crosse without
any competition, had obtained what they call the attachment
of the Indians, that is to say, they had reduced them to such
abject submission that the very sight of a Canadian was sufficient
to inspire them with terror. In order that this salutary
awe might suffer no diminution, the post at Isle a la Crosse
was reinforced with an extra number of Canadians, so that
the natives might be effectually prevented from holding any
intercourse with the traders of the Hudson's Bay Company,
and that the appearance of so very superior a force, ready to
overwhelm and destroy him, might deter Mr. Fidler from any
attempt to protect his customers. A watch-house was built
close to his door, so that no Indian could enter unobserved;
a party of professed batteilleurs were stationed here, and
employed not only to watch the natives, but to give every
possible annoyance, night and day, to the servants of the
Hudson's Bay Company. Their fire-wood was stolen, they
were perpetually obstructed in hunting for provisions, the
produce of their garden was destroyed, their fishing lines
taken away in the night time, and their nets, on which
they chiefly relied for subsistence, cut to pieces. The ruffians
who were posted to watch Mr. Fidler, proceeded from one act
of violence to another, and in proportion as they found themselves
feebly resisted, they grew bolder, and at length issued
a formal mandate that not one of the servants of the Hudson's
Bay Company should stir out of their house, and followed up
this with such examples of severity that Mr. Fidler's men
refused to remain at the post. They were compelled to leave
it, and the Canadians immediately burnt his house to the
ground.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The
robbery
at Bad Lake.</p>

<p>A trader, William Corrigal, in the service of the Company,
was stationed, in May, 1806, with a few men at a place called
Bad Lake, not far from Albany Factory. Near this post was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
another occupied by a much larger number of men in charge
of a partner in the North-West concern named Haldane.
Five of the Canadians in his service watching their opportunity
broke into Corrigal's house about midnight when he
and his men were in bed. The ruffians immediately secured all
the loaded guns and pistols they could find, and one of them
seizing the Company's trader and presenting a pistol at his
breast swore to shoot him if he made any resistance. In the
meantime the others rifled the storehouse and took away furs
to the number of 480 beaver. On their departure Corrigal
dressed himself and went immediately to Haldane,
whom he found up, and fully attired, to
complain of the conduct of his servants and
to demand that the stolen property be restored.
The answer of the Northman was that "He had come to
that country for furs, and furs he was determined to
have." The robbers were permitted to carry away the stolen
peltries to the Grand Portage where they were sold, and
formed part of the returns of the North-West concern that
year. A robbery of the same character took place at Red
Lake a little later in the year. This trading house was also
under the charge of Corrigal, and was forcibly entered by
eight of the Northmen, armed with pistols and knives; under
threats to murder the servants of the Hudson's Bay Company
they carried off furs to the amount of fifty beaver. Not long
after this they forcibly broke open the same warehouse and
robbed it of a large quantity of cloth, brandy, tobacco and
ammunition.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Violence and
robbery
by the
North-West
Company.</p>

<p>In the year 1808 Mr. John Spence, of the Hudson's Bay
Company, commanded a post fitted out from Churchill's Factory
at Reindeer Lake, in the neighbourhood of which there
was a station of the North-West Company commanded by
Mr. John Duncan Campbell, one of the partners. In the
course of the spring, William Linklater, in the service of the
Hudson's Bay Company, was sent out to meet some Indians,
from whom he traded a parcel of valuable furs. He was
bringing them home on a hand sleigh, and was at no great
distance from the house, when Campbell came out with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
number of men, stopped him, demanded the furs, and on
being refused drew a dagger, with which he cut the traces
of the sledge, while at the same time one of
his men took hold of Linklater's shoes, tripped
him up, and made him fall on the ice. The
sledge of furs was then hauled away to the
North-West concern's house. Campbell offered
to Mr. Spence to send other furs in exchange for those which
he had thus robbed him of; but they were of very inferior
value, and the latter refused the compromise. The furs were
carried away, and no compensation was ever made.</p>

<p>On a previous occasion, at Isle a la Crosse Lake (in the
year 1805), the same Campbell had attacked two of the
servants of the Hudson's Bay Company, and took a parcel of
furs from them in the same way. Some of the men from
the Hudson's Bay House came out to assist their fellow-servants,
but were attacked by superior numbers of the
Canadians, and beaten off, with violence and bloodshed.</p>

<p>England was again at war with France. Napoleon had
placed an embargo on English commerce, and to the uttermost
corner of Europe was this measure felt. Tons of the
most costly furs, for which there was no market, lay heaped
in the Company's warehouse. The greatest difficulty was
experienced in procuring servants, especially seamen, and
when these were procured, they were often seized by a press-gang;
shares began to decline in value; numerous partners
were selling out their interests, and no strong man appeared
at the head of affairs.</p>

<p>In 1808 no dividend was paid, chiefly the result of the non-exportation
of the Company's furs to the Continent of Europe.
There were the accumulations of furs imported during 1806,
1807 and 1808 lying in the warehouse without prospect of
sale.</p>

<p>The pressure still continued and at last, in 1809, the Company
was driven to petition the Chancellor of the Exchequer
for transmission to Lords of the Treasury, setting forth the
Company's position and its claims on the nation.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Company
in difficulties.</p>

<p>"Accumulated difficulties," it said, "have pressed hardly on
the Company and we ask assistance to maintain a colony
that till now has found within itself resources to
withstand the pressure of all former wars and
to continue those outfits on which six hundred
Europeans and their families and some thousands of native
Indians depend for their very existence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span></p>

<p>"We assure your worships that it was not until all those
resources were exhausted that we came to the resolution of
making the present application."</p>

<p>The petition recited that after having received their charter
the Company had colonized such parts of newly granted
territories as appeared most convenient for carrying on their
commerce with the natives. This commerce "consisted in the
barter of British manufactures for the furs of animals killed
by the different tribes of Indians who were within reach of
factories and gradually extended itself till, as at the present
moment, the manufactures of Great Britain are borne by the
traders of Hudson's Bay over the face of the whole country
from Lake Superior to the Athabasca.</p>

<p>"The trade is at present pursued by the export of furs,
gunpowder, shot, woollens, hardware and other articles, which
together with large supplies of provisions for the factories,
constitute an annual outfit consisting wholly of British
manufactures and British produce of from £40,000 to
£50,000, in return for which we receive the furs of bears,
wolves, foxes, otters, martens, beaver and other animals,
together with some oil and articles of inferior value. The
cargoes are sold at public sale. The beaver and some few
inferior furs, together with the oil, are bought for home consumption
and sell for about £30,000, but the fine furs were, till
after the sale of 1806, bought by the fur merchants for the
fairs of Frankfort and of Leipsic for Petersburg, and
before the present war, for France. Since that year there has
not been a fur sold for exportation, and as a proof to your
worships that the deficiency of buyers did not arise from our
holding back for a higher market, we sold in 1806 for seven
shillings per skin furs that in the more quiet state of Europe
in 1804 had brought us 20s. 3d., and which for years previous
to that time had sold for a similar price; and other depreciation
pervaded in about the same proportion the whole of those
furs calculated only for the foreign market, and in some
instances furs were sold for a less price than the duties we
had paid for them.</p>

<p>"Since that period no orders have been received from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
abroad, and our warehouses are filled with the most valuable
productions of three years' import that if sold at the prices of
those years before the closing of the ports on the Continent
would have produced us at least £150,000.</p>

<p>"It may be objected to us, that we were improvident in
pursuing under such circumstances a trade which must so
inevitably tend to ruin. But a certainty that a considerable
quantity of furs found their way to New York, and an earnest
zeal for the preservation of trade which by the conduct of
the Hudson's Bay Company had been secured to this country
for a century and a half, prompted us to every exertion to
maintain the footing we had established, and the annually
increasing amount of our trade gave us just grounds to look
forward with confidence to the opening of the northern ports
of Europe as the period when all our difficulties would
cease; an event which, anterior to the battles of Austerlitz
or of Jena, was looked for with the most sanguine expectation.</p>

<p>"Above all were we impelled by the strongest motives to
continue these supplies which were necessary for the subsistence
of six hundred European servants, their wives and children,
dispersed over a vast and extended field of the North
American Continent, and who would not be brought to
Europe under a period of three years as well as those upon
whom the many Indian nations now depend for their very
existence.</p>

<p>"The nations of hunters taught for one hundred and fifty
years the use of fire-arms could no more resort, with certainty,
to the bow or the javelin for their daily subsistence. Accustomed
to the hatchet of Great Britain, they could ill adopt
the rude sharpened stone to the purposes of building, and
until years of misery and of famine had extirpated the present
race, they could not recur to the simple arts by which
they supported themselves before the introduction of British
manufactures. As the outfits of the Hudson's Bay Company
consist principally of articles which long habit have
taught them now to consider of first necessity, if we withhold
these outfits, we leave them destitute of their only means of
support. The truth of this observation had a melancholy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
proof in the year 1782, when from the attack made upon the
settlements by La Pérouse, and the consequent failure of our
supplies, many of the Indians were found starved to death.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Petition of
the Company.</p>

<p>"It was not only from the firm conviction that we felt of
the necessity of European manufactures to the present existence
of whole nations of North American Indians that we
considered ourselves bound by the most powerful ties to exert
every effort in their favour; but also that we might continue
to them those advantages which would result to their religious
as well as civil welfare from the progressive improvements,
and a gradual system of civilisation and education which
we have introduced throughout the country;
improvements which are now diffusing the
comforts of civilized life, as well as the blessings
of the Christian faith to thousands of uninstructed
Indians, and would in their completion, we can confidently
assert, have tended to the future cultivation of lands, which
from experiments we found capable of growing most of the
grains of Northern Europe, and from their climate adapted to
the culture of hemp and flax, and from the labour of those
families who would have been induced to settle at our factories,
might soon have brought to this country the produce of the
boundless forests of pine that spread themselves over almost
the southern parts of our possessions.</p>

<p>"To realize these not visionary schemes, but sure and certain
plans, founded upon the progressive civilization of the
natives, were objects not to be given up without the most
urgent necessity, and the hope that the ruler of the French
Empire could not forever shut out our trade from Europe,
induced us to resort to every means within our power to preserve
the advantages resulting to ourselves and to the Indians,
and to the British nation.</p>

<p>"We have exhausted those funds which we set apart for
their completion; we have pledged our credit till we feel, as
honest men, that upon the present uncertainty we can pledge
it no farther, and we throw ourselves upon your Worship's
wisdom to afford us that temporary assistance which we
cannot ask at any other hands.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span></p>

<p>"Were we to resort to the early history of our settlements,
we might lay the foundations of just claims upon the public
to assist our present wants. We could show instances of
most destructive attacks by the French upon our factories.
Our forts and military works, mounted with a numerous and
expensive artillery for the defence of the colony against their
future operations, were destroyed and the guns ruined. And
particularly was a most grievous loss occasioned to us by the
predatory attack of La Pérouse about the conclusion of the
American War, which caused the distress to which we have
above alluded.</p>

<p>"Against these pressures when our trade flourished we were
able to hold up, and we found within ourselves those resources
which defeated the enemy's views and continued to Great
Britain the trade we had established.</p>

<p>"And it is not until pressed to our last resort that we ask of
your Lordships that assistance with which we may confidently
hope to preserve our trade until the continent may be again
opened, when we shall be delivered from those difficulties
under which we are now sinking."</p>

<p>The petition was signed by Wm. Mainwaring, Governor;
Joseph Berens, Deputy Governor; George Hyde Wollaston,
Thomas Neave, Job Mathew Raikes, Thomas Langley, John
Henry Pelly, Benjamin Harrison, John Webb.</p>

<p>In April the Adventurers petitioned the King in Council to
reduce duties on furs to one-half, or trade must suffer extinction.
No profit was derivable, it said, on marten, wolf, bear,
wolverine and fisher-skins.</p>

<p>To this petition the Office of Committee of Privy Council
for Trade, Whitehall, replied in the following February, that
the memorial of the Hudson's Bay Company contained no
proposition on which the Lords of this Council could "offer
any opinion to the Lords of Treasury."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Small
Government
assistance.</p>

<p>As their petition was denied, the Company now boldly prepared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
a request and asked for a loan of £60,000, and that time
be extended for paying the duties on furs imported
until the continental market re-opened. To this
request an answer was returned, allowing twelve
months storage of furs free of duty and promising
drawbacks as if storage had only been for one year, but
stating that there were no funds out of which a loan could
be made without special authority of Parliament.</p>

<p>It was clear that the Company was in very low water, and
that some new salutary policy was demanded. By way of
a beginning, barter was abolished as a basis of trade, and
money payments ordered. At the same time the Adventurers
stole a leaf out of the book of the North-West company, and
new regulations, comprising thirty-five articles, were made in
the early months of 1810, for carrying on the business in
Hudson's Bay.</p>

<p>The principle of allowing to their chief officers a considerable
participation in the profits of their trade was admitted.
It was found absolutely necessary to adopt some step of this
sort, as nothing of such a measure could be sufficient to stem
the torrent of aggression with which they had been assailed
by the North-West company; and their absolute ruin must
have ensued if some effectual means had not been taken, not
only to rectify some of the abuses which had crept in under
the former system, but also to rouse their officers to a more
effectual resistance of the lawless violence practised against
them.</p>

<p>The total lack of jurisdiction in the Indian country, as the
territory which was the scene of the operations of the fur-traders
was called, permitted crime to go unpunished, and
numerous representations were made in respect to the evils of
this practical immunity from punishment. In Sir Alexander
Mackenzie's letter of the 25th of October, 1802, he says that,
in view of the improbability of the two companies amalgamating,
a jurisdiction should be established as speedily
as possible, to prevent the contending fur companies from
abusing the power either might possess, so as to secure to
each the fruits of fair, honest and industrious exertion; it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
would also, he believed, tend to put a stop to the increasing
animosity between the two companies. Mr. Richardson, of
the other company, also pressed for the establishment of a
competent jurisdiction and instanced the case of one of the
clerks in his company who had killed a clerk of the other in
defending the property in his care. The young man had
come to Montreal to be tried, but there being no jurisdiction
there for such trial, "he remains in the deplorable predicament
that neither his innocence nor his guilt can be legally
ascertained." He also proposed that a military post should
be established at Thunder Bay, on Lake Superior, as an additional
means of securing peace.</p>

<p>Repeatedly had the Grand Juries of Quebec and Montreal
called attention to this want of jurisdiction. In one report
the number of people from the Canadas, chiefly from Lower
Canada, was urged as one reason for establishing in the
Indian country a court of competent jurisdiction for the trial
of offences committed in these territories, including Hudson's
Bay.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Plea for
establishment
of
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>"The very heavy expense," observes the report, "incident
to the conveyance of offenders from the Territory of Hudson's
Bay to England, with the necessary witnesses on both sides,
and the cost of prosecution and defence, must generally
operate, either to prevent recourse to a tribunal across the
ocean, and thereby stimulate to private retaliation and
revenge, or where such course can or shall be had, the guilty
may escape punishment, and the innocent be
sacrificed from the distance of time and place
of trial, the death or absence of witnesses, or
other causes; and the mind cannot contemplate
without horror the possible abuses to which
such circumstances might give rise; as in the instance of a
prosecutor coming from and at a remote day, when the
accused may be destitute of pecuniary means, and the
exculpatory evidence may either be dead, removed, or be
otherwise beyond his reach, who at all events (however
innocent he may finally be found) will have undergone a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
long and painful confinement, far removed from his family
and connections, and perhaps ruinous to every prospect he
had in life."</p>

<p>Sir Robert Milnes strongly supported the representation of
the Grand Jury, and added that "Under such circumstances
every species of offence is to be apprehended, from Trespasses
to Murder," and also that "the national character of the
English will be debased among the Indians, and the numerous
tribes of those people will in consequence thereof be more
easily wrought upon by foreign emissaries employed by the
Enemies of Great Britain."<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>In consequence of these representations Lord Hobart
promised that immediate steps should be taken to remedy the
existing state of affairs. But Milnes became impatient for
a decision, and writing in September, 1803, to the Under-Secretary,
he reminded him of the promise, the great increase
and extent of the fur-trade rendering such an Act daily more
necessary. The Act to give jurisdiction to the Courts of
Upper and Lower Canada had, however, been assented to on
the 11th of the preceding month.</p>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">Canada
Jurisdiction
Act.</p>

<p>The first case brought to trial under the Act became
celebrated. In the autumn of 1809 William Corrigal was the
trader at a Company's post near Eagle Lake.
On the 15th of September a party of North-Westers
established an encampment about
forty yards from the Company's post, under
one of their clerks, Aeneas MacDonnell. In the evening
an Indian arrived in his canoe to trade with Corrigal and
to pay a debt which he owed him. As he was not able to
defray the whole amount, Corrigal accepted the canoe in part
payment. The Indian requested that it might be lent to him
for a few days, which was agreed to; and the Indian spent
the night at the post with his canoe. In the morning he
received in advance some more merchandise, such as clothing
for his family and ammunition for his winter hunt. When he
finally departed, three of the Company's servants were sent
down to the wharf with the canoe and the goods. On their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
way they were observed by a number of Northmen, including
MacDonnell, who went immediately down to the lake, armed
with a sword and accompanied by a voyageur named
Adhemer, armed with a brace of pistols. Upon pretence that
the unhappy Red man was indebted to the North-West
company, they proceeded to seize and drag away the canoe
and the merchandise to their own wharf. Corrigal observing
this, commanded two of his men, James Tate and John
Corrigal, to go into the water and prevent the seizure, and as
they approached on this mission MacDonnell drew his
sword and struck two blows at Tate's head. The latter was
unarmed, and warded the blows with his wrist, which was
severely gashed. He then received another deep wound in
the neck, which felled him to the ground. In the meantime
Adhemer had seized John Corrigal (who was also unarmed)
and presenting a cocked pistol at his head, swore that if he
went near the canoe he would blow out his brains.</p>

<p>Several of the Company's servants who were near the spot,
perceiving what was going on, and observing that the rest of
MacDonnell's men were collecting with arms, ran up to their
own house, which was only about forty or fifty yards from
the lake, for weapons of defence. MacDonnell next attacked
John Corrigal, who to escape him ran into the lake. Finding
the water too deep, however, he was soon obliged to make
a turn towards the shore. His pursuer wading after him,
aimed a blow at him with his sword, cut his arm above
the elbow and laid the bone bare. He followed this up
with a tremendous blow at his head, which Robert Leask,
one of the Company's servants, fortunately warded off with
the paddle of his canoe, which was cut in two by the blow.
The North-West leader in a fury now attacked another
servant named Essen, aimed a blow at him with his sword,
which, however, only struck his hat off. But in making his
escape Essen fell into the water. Before he could recover
himself another Canadian aimed a blow at his head with a
heavy axe, which missed its aim, but dislocated his shoulder,
so that he could make no use of his arm for over two months
after this affray.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Killing of
MacDonnell.</p>

<p>MacDonnell and Adhemer, the one with a drawn sword
and the other with a cocked pistol, continued to
pursue several other of the Company's servants
towards the fort, when one of them, named
John Mowat, whom MacDonnell had previously
struck with his sword, and was preparing to strike again,
shot MacDonnell on the spot.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Trial of
Mowat.</p>

<p>MacDonnell's body was carried away, and the parties
separated, Corrigal fearing a further attack. On the 24th, a
partner of the North-West Company, named Haldane, arrived
in a canoe with ten men, and on the following day another
partner, McLellan, also arrived. They came to the gates of
the stockades, behind which Corrigal and his men had barricaded
themselves, and demanded the man who had shot
MacDonnell. They declared that if the person was not
immediately given up they would either shoot every one of
the Company's men, or get the Indians to kill them, were it
even to cost them a keg of brandy for each of their heads!
Mowat now stepped forward and acknowledged that he was
the man, and that he would shoot MacDonnell again in the
same circumstances. Much to his surprise the North-Westers
announced their intention of taking him and two witnesses
down to Montreal for trial. Mowat was thereupon put in
irons. From the 2nd of October, when they arrived at Rainy
Lake, the unhappy man was generally kept in irons from six
in the morning till eight in the evening, and during the night
until the 14th of December. During the whole winter he was
kept in close confinement, and the two witnesses, Tate and
Leask, who had voluntarily accompanied him, were themselves
subjected to much insult and indignity, and were obliged to
submit to every species of drudgery and labour in order to
obtain a bare subsistence. In June the whole party, including
Corrigal, arrived at Fort William, the chief trading-post rendezvous
of the North-Westers. Here Mowat was imprisoned
in a close and miserable dungeon, about six feet square, without
any window or light of any kind whatsoever, and when he
finally reached Montreal he was in a most pitiable condition.
The witnesses were seized on a charge of aiding and abetting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
the murder of MacDonnell, and this upon the oath of one of
the North-West half-breeds. The Hudson's Bay Company
had at this time no agent or correspondent at
Montreal or any place in Canada, and it was
not until the end of November that the Honourable
Adventurers heard of the prosecution being carried
on against their servants. Immediate steps were taken for
their protection, and counsel engaged for the defence. Mowat
and his witnesses were indicted for murder. The grand jury
found a true bill against Mowat, but not against the others,
and Tate and Leask were accordingly discharged.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>In spite of the evidence, the jury brought in a verdict of
manslaughter. The judge, however, had charged them to
find it murder. Mowat was sentenced to be imprisoned six
months and branded on the hand with a hot iron. After his
discharge, two years from the time he was first put in irons at
Eagle Lake, Mowat proceeded from Canada to the United
States in order to return to England, but was never heard
of again. He is supposed to have been drowned by the
breaking of the ice in one of the rivers he had to cross on
his way.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Earl of
Selkirk.</p>

<p>Such was the situation in the early years of the century.
At this time there rose a name destined to be of more than
local fame, that of Thomas Douglas, fifth Earl of Selkirk, a
young man of benevolent character, whose feelings had been
deeply moved by the sufferings of his countrymen in the
Scottish Highlands. Nor was the nobleman's compassion
excited without cause. A compulsory exodus of the inhabitants
of the mountainous regions in the county of Sutherland
was in progress. The tale of expulsion of a vast number of
poor tenantry from the estates of the Duchess of Sutherland,
which they and their ancestors had looked
upon as their own without the necessity of
rent and taxes, may be heard to-day from
some white-haired old grandfather, who had it from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
lips of his sire, in the far north of Scotland. The system of
rents and land-management as it prevails to-day all over the
Highlands had only then been put in force, and the squatters
were driven to seek their homes as best they might in the
remote and sequestered places of the earth. Selkirk encouraged
this emigration as the only remedy; and having
endeavoured in vain to secure the active co-operation of the
Government, resolved to settle a colony on waste lands
granted him in Prince Edward Island. The better to ensure
success, he went in person to oversee the whole enterprise.
Gathering together about eight hundred of these poor people,
who bade a melancholy farewell to their heather-robed hills,
they arrived at their future home early in September, 1803.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0394" id="im_0394"></a>
<img src="images/im_0394.jpg" width="323" height="377" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Lord Selkirk.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Selkirk visited Montreal in this and also in the following
year on matters connected with his philanthropic undertaking,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
and on both occasions evinced the heartiest interest in the
great territory to the north-west which formed the theatre of
action for the two rival fur-trading companies.</p>

<p>The Prince Edward Island colony continuing to prosper,
Lord Selkirk now conceived the plan of forming a colony on
the banks of the Red River, in Rupert's Land.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> In order to
execute his project with a greater assurance of success, he
again, in 1805, addressed the British Government and nation,
pointing out the successful issue of his colony as an example
of the excellent results which would attend a further exodus
of the superfluous population.</p>

<p>Time went on and the execution of the plan being still in
abeyance, the great decline in Hudson's Bay stock suggested
an idea to Selkirk. He submitted the charter to several of
the highest legal authorities in England, and got from them
the following:</p>

<p>"We are of the opinion that the grant of the said contained
charter is good, and that it will include all the country, the
waters of which run into Hudson's Bay, as ascertained by
geographical observations.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Legal opinion
on the Company's
charter.</p>

<p>"We are of opinion that an individual holding from the
Hudson's Bay Company a lease or grant in fee simple of any
part of their territory, will be entitled to all the
ordinary rights of landed property in England,
and will be entitled to prevent other persons
from occupying any part of the lands; from
cutting down timber and fishing in the adjoining waters (being
such as a private right of fishing may subsist in), and may (if
he can peaceably or otherwise in due course of law) dispossess
them of any buildings which they have recently erected within
the limits of their property.</p>

<p>"We are of opinion that the grant of the civil and criminal
jurisdiction is valid, though it is not granted to the Company,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
but to the Governor and Council at their respective establishments.
We cannot recommend, however, it to be exercised
so as to affect the lives or limbs of criminals. It is to be
exercised by the Governor and Council as judges, who are to
proceed according to the laws of England.</p>

<p>"The Company may appoint a sheriff to execute judgments
and do his duty as in England.</p>

<p>"We are of opinion that the sheriff, in case of resistance
to his authority, may collect the population to his assistance,
and put arms into the hands of his servants for defence
against attack, and to assist in enforcing the judgments of
the courts; but such powers cannot be exercised with too
much circumspection.</p>

<p>"We are of opinion that all persons will be subject to the
jurisdiction of the court, who reside or are found within the
territories over which it extends.</p>

<p>"We do not think the Canada Jurisdiction Act (43 George
III.) gives jurisdiction within the territories of the Hudson's
Bay Company, the same being within the jurisdiction of their
own governors and council.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>"We are of opinion that the Governor (in Hudson's) might
under the authority of the Company, appoint constables and
other officers for the preservation of the peace and that the
officers so appointed would have the same duties and privileges
as the same officers in England, so far as these duties and privileges
may be applicable to their situation in the territories of
the Company." This was signed by Sir Samuel Ronully, Mr.
Justice Holroyd, W. M. Cruise, J. Scarlett and John Bell.
There could be thus no question of Selkirk's right. The
Company's charter, amongst other provisions, expressly forbids
all English subjects from entering, without license or
authority, upon the territories of the Hudson's Bay Company.
The Governor and Company only are empowered to grant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
such authority and on them also is conferred the right of
establishing castles, fortifications, forts, garrisons, colonies,
plantations, towns and villages, in any parts or places within
the limits of their territory. They had also the right of sending
ships of war, men or ammunition, to their colonies,
fortifications or plantations, and of appointing governors, commanders
and officers over them.</p>

<p>Selkirk began by purchasing several thousand pounds
worth of shares in the Company.</p>

<p>Late in 1810 he made a formal proposition to the Company,
a proposition previously made and rejected, for a settlement
to be made within its territory. This time some of the
Honourable Adventurers began to see that the scheme might
be fraught with salvation for themselves.</p>

<p>Lord Selkirk was asked to lay before the committee the
terms on which he would accept a grant of land within the
Hudson's Bay territories, "specifying what restrictions he
would be prepared to consent to be imposed on the settlers."
Also what security he would offer to the Company against
any injury to its trade or to its rights and privileges.</p>

<p>Lord Selkirk responded to this, and his proposals were
agreed to, subject to final approbation of a general court of
all the Adventurers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Selkirk's
project.</p>

<p>It now dawned upon the wiser spirits that here was being
offered them the means for the Company's salvation. Nevertheless,
the traditional opposition of the Company to any project
of the kind still lingered, and was not easily disposed of.
For weeks the meetings in committee resounded with appeals
to "traditional policy," to "loyalty to the noble, the ancient
founders," to "a spirit of reverence for the history
of our Company," but all to no purpose.
Selkirk was to carry the day. A general court
was convened, by public notice, in May 1811, when the stockholders
were informed that the Governor and Committee
considered it beneficial to their general interests to grant Lord
Selkirk 116,000 square miles of their territory, on condition
that he should establish a colony and furnish, on certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
terms, from amongst the settlers, such labourers as would
be required by the Company in their trade.</p>

<p>In order to give the partners a further opportunity of
making themselves fully informed of the nature of the proposed
measure, an adjournment of the court took place. In
the meanwhile notice was given to all the stockholders that
the terms of the proposed grant were left at the secretary's
office for their inspection.</p>

<p>This interval was the opportunity of McGillivray and his
friends.</p>

<p>In certain quarters, no pains or misrepresentations were
spared by persons associated with the North-West Company
to prejudice the public mind against it. The newspapers
teemed with falsehoods representing the country as cold or
barren, as a dreary waste or interminable forest, unfit to be the
abode of men and incapable of improvement. Selkirk was
accosted in Pall Mall by a friend who remarked: "By God,
sir, if you are bent on doing something futile, why do you not
sow tares at home in order to reap wheat, or plough the
desert of Sahara, which is nearer."</p>

<p>Old servants of the Company came forward to dispel these
calumnies, and seeing their first falsehoods destroyed, Selkirk's
enemies now proceeded to follow new tactics. They spoke
with feigned alarm concerning the hostile disposition of the
aborigines; they lamented with affected sympathy and
humanity the injuries and slaughters to which the colonists
would be exposed from the savages.</p>

<p>At the adjourned meeting the proposition was again discussed
amidst the greatest excitement and tumult, and
adopted. A memorial or protest was however entered against
the measure, bearing the signature of six of the proprietors.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Opposition by
agents of the
North-West
Company.</p>

<p>Of these six signing the protest, three were persons closely
connected with and interested in the rival commercial concerns
of the North-West Company of Montreal; and two of
the three were, at the very moment, avowed London agents
of that association. These had become proprietors of Hudson's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
Bay stock only eight and forty hours before the general
meeting. They were not indeed possessed of it
long enough to entitle them to vote at the meeting;
but their names now being entered in the
Company's books, though the ink was scarcely
dry with which they were inserted, they felt themselves
competent to formally raise their voices in condemnation of
those measures which the committee of directors unanimously,
and the general court by a great majority, had approved of.</p>

<p>Their design in acquiring the Company's stock was obvious.
However circuitous the stratagem might be, it was clear that
they had thus become proprietors of one commercial company
for the purpose of advancing the fortunes of another, and a
rival concern.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The stratagem did not altogether fail, for
Lord Selkirk's agents were yet to encounter much friction in
distant quarters supposed to be friendly, and required to be
obedient to the orders of the Company.</p>

<p>When the vote was taken, it was found that for the question
there appeared holders of stock valued at £29,937; against
it, £14,823. The Earl, himself, voted "for"&mdash;£4,087;
the principal opponent of the scheme being one William
Thwaytes, whose interest was represented at £9,233.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span></p>

<p>At this meeting a memorial was read violently opposing
the scheme, signed by Thwaytes and four or five others.
According to them, the main objections were:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Impolitic;
(<i>b</i>) Consideration inadequate; (<i>c</i>) Grant asked for very large
proportion of Company's holding, viz.: 70,000 square miles,
or about 45,000,000 acres; (<i>d</i>) Should be a public sale, if
any, not a private contract with a member of the Company;
(<i>e</i>) No penalty for failure to find settlers; (<i>f</i>) Colonization
unfavourable to the fur-trade; private traffic would be
carried on with the United States of America.</p>

<p>The Earl proposed to find a number of effective men as
servants to the Hudson's Bay Company in return for a grant
of land, viz., two hundred men for ten years, from 1812, who
would every year be ready to embark between May 1st and
July 1st at an appointed place in Scotland.</p>

<p>The Company were to pay wages to each man not exceeding
£20. Should the Earl fail, he agreed to forfeit £10 per
man short of two hundred. As to proposed grants of land
to settlers, two hundred acres were to be given to labourers
or artificers; one thousand acres to a master of a trading-house.
The Company were, of course, to have full rights of
access to all the surrendered districts.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Earl Selkirk's
proposal
accepted.</p>

<p>The customs duties, exports and imports, payable by
settlers were not to exceed five per cent, at Port Nelson,
unless it happened that a higher duty was levied at Quebec.
The duties so to be levied were to be applied to the expense
of Government police, communication between
Lake Winnipeg and Port Nelson, etc., and not
to be taken as profits for the Company. The
show of hands was in favour of the proposal;
but a protest was handed in to the Governor by Thwaytes and
others. In spite of this, on the 13th of June, the deed was
signed, sealed and delivered by the secretary on behalf of
the Company.</p>

<p>The lands were defined by deed as situate between 52° 30'
north latitude and 102° 30' west longitude, a map being
affixed to the deed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span></p>

<p>In reading this protest, one who was ignorant of the true
state of affairs would have been led to believe that the
partners concerned had no object so dear to them as the
welfare and prosperity of the Hudson's Bay Company.
These gentlemen appeared to be animated by the most
thorough devotion and zeal, as they stood together declaiming
in loud, earnest tones against the errors into which their
beloved Company was falling, and pouring out their sympathy
to the emigrant settlers who might be lured to their
destruction by establishing themselves on the lands so granted
"out of reach," to employ their own phrase, "of all those
aids and comforts which are derived from civil society;" and
so it did truly appear to many then as it has done since.
But let us examine those signatures, and lo, the wolf obtrudes
himself basking in the skin of a lamb!</p>

<p>The grant was thus confirmed. The opposition had found
itself powerless, and Selkirk was put into possession of a
territory only 5,115 square miles less than the entire area of
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The grant secured, Selkirk at once despatched agents to
Ireland and throughout the highlands of Scotland, to engage
servants, some for the Company's service, others for general
labourers in the colony. These last were known as "his lordship's
servants," and were engaged for a term of years, at the
expiration of which they became entitled to one hundred acres
of land, free of cost. They were placed under the charge of
Miles McDonnell, who received a joint appointment from
Selkirk and the Company, as first Governor of the new
colony.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Selkirk's
immigrants
arrive.</p>

<p>The first section of the immigrant party arrived at York
Factory late in the autumn of 1811.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> This post was then in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
charge of William Auld, who, as we have seen, occupied the
position of Superintendent of the Northern
Department of Rupert's Land. After a short
residence at the fort, where they were treated in
a somewhat tyrannical and high-handed fashion
by the Governor, who had scant sympathy for the new <i>régime</i>,
the party were sent forward to Seal Creek, fifty miles up
Nelson River. Governor McDonnell and one Hillier, in the
character of justice of the peace, accompanied them thither,
and preparations were at once made for the erection of a
suitable shelter.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0402" id="im_0402"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Stornaway.</span><br />
(<i>The Hebrides.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>McDonnell experienced a great deal of trouble during the
winter with the men under his charge, for a mutinous spirit
broke out, and he was put to his wits' end to enforce discipline.
He put it all down to the Glasgow servants. "These
Glasgow rascals," he declared to Auld, the Governor of York
Factory, "have caused us both much trouble and uneasiness.
A more stubborn, litigious and cross-grained lot were never
put under any person's care. I cannot think that any
liberality of rum or rations could have availed to stop their
dissatisfaction. Army and navy discipline is the only thing
fit to manage such fierce spirits."</p>

<p>But the Irish of the party were hardly more tractable.
On New Year's night, 1812, a violent and unprovoked attack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
was made by some of the Irish on a party of Orkneymen,
who were celebrating the occasion. Three of the latter were
so severely beaten that for a month the surgeon could not
report their lives entirely out of danger. Four of the Irishmen
concerned in this assault were sent back home. "Worthless
blackguards," records the Governor; "the lash may
make them serviceable to the Government in the army or
navy, but they will never do for us."</p>

<p>On the subject of the Orkney servants of the Company all
critics were not agreed. Governor McDonnell's opinion, for
instance, was not flattering:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There cannot," he reported, "be much improvement made
in the country while the Orkneymen form the majority of
labourers; they are lazy, spiritless, and ill-disposed&mdash;wedded
to old habits, strongly prejudiced against any change, however
beneficial. It was with the utmost reluctance they could be
prevailed on to drink the spruce juice to save themselves
from the scurvy; they think nothing of the scurvy, as they
are then idle, and their wages run on.... It is not
uncommon for an Orkneyman to consume six pounds or
eight pounds of meat in a day, and some have ate as much in
a single meal. This gluttonous appetite, they say, is occasioned
by the cold. I entirely discredit the assertion, as I
think it rather to be natural to themselves. All the labour I
have seen these men do would scarcely pay for the victuals
they consume. With twenty-five men belonging to it, the
factory was last winter distressed for firewood, and the people
sent to tent in the woods."<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Opposition
by the
Nor'-Westers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, leaving the shivering immigrants, distrustful of
their officers and doubtful of what the future had in store for
them, to encamp at Seal Creek, let us turn to
the state of affairs amongst the parties concerned
elsewhere, particularly amongst the Nor'-Westers.
Simon McGillivray, who was agent in
London for that Company, watched all Selkirk's acts with the
utmost distrust, and kept the partners continually informed
of the turn affairs were taking. He assured them that Selkirk's
philanthropy was all a cloak, designed to cover up a scheme
for the total extinction of the Hudson's Bay Company's rivals.
The colony was to be planted to ruin their trade. It was
an endeavour to check the physical superiority of the
Nor'-Westers and by means of this settlement secure to the
Hudson's Bay Company and to himself, not only the extensive
and sole trade of the country within their own territories,
but a "safe and convenient stepping-stone for monopolizing
all the fur-trade of the Far West."</p>

<p>The partners in Montreal were stirred to action. Regarding
Lord Selkirk's motives in this light, they warmly disputed
the validity of the Hudson's Bay Company's Charter and of
the grants of land made to him. It was decided to bring all
the forces of opposition they possessed to bear on this
"invasion of their hunting grounds."</p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<br />
1812-1815.</h2>

<p class="hanging">

Northmen to the Company&mdash;Robertson's Expedition to Athabasca&mdash;Affairs

</p>

<p class="sidenote">The
Bois-Brulés.</p>

<p>There had lately been witnessed the rapid growth of a new
class&mdash;sprung from the loins of Red man and European.
Alert, rugged, turbulent, they evinced at the same time a passionate
love of the life and manners of the wilderness, and a
fierce intractability which could hardly fail to cause occasional
uneasiness in the minds of their masters. To this class had
been given the name of Métis, or Bois-Brulés.
They were principally the descendants
of the French voyageurs of the North-West
concern, who had allied themselves with Indian
women and settled down on the shore of some lake or stream
in the interior. Amongst these half-breeds hunters and
trappers came, and at a later period a number of Englishmen
and Scotchmen, hardly less strongly linked to a wild, hardy life
than themselves. These also took Indian wives, and they and
their children spoke of themselves as neither English, Scotch,
or Indian, but as belonging to the "New Nation."</p>

<p>From 1812 to 1821 the North-West concern absorbed all
the labours and exacted the loyalty of the increasing class of
Bois-Brulés. The Hudson's Bay Company was exclusively
an English company, and their Scotch and English servants
had left few traces of an alliance with the aborigines. As the
posts in the interior began to multiply, and the men were
thus cut off from the larger society which obtained at York,
Cumberland and Moose factories, and were thrown more upon
their own resources, a laxer discipline prevailed, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
example of their neighbours was followed. A time was to
come when the "Orkney half-breeds" equalled in point of
numbers those of the French Bois-Brulés.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0406" id="im_0406"></a>
<img src="images/im_0406.jpg" width="373" height="520" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Bois-Brulé.</span></p>
</div>

<p>There were yet few half-breeds of English extraction. The
Bois-Brulés were passionately attached to the North-West
company, who were quick to recognize their value as agents
amongst the Indians. The idea of nationality, so far from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
being frowned upon, was encouraged amongst them. So
much for the instruments which the Company proposed to
employ in Montreal.</p>

<p>It was only natural that amongst this rude race there
should arise a leader, a half-breed to whose superior ability
and natural advantages was added an education in Montreal,
the seat of the co-partnery. Cuthbert Grant, which was the
name this individual bore, was known far and wide amongst
the hunters and trappers of Rupert's Land, and everywhere
commanded homage and respect. He had risen to be one of
the most enterprising and valued agents of the Nor'-Westers,
and was constantly admitted to their councils.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of May, 1811, at which period the matter
was in embryo in London, Simon McGillivray had frankly
declared to Miles McDonnell, agent to Lord Selkirk, that he
was "determined to give all the opposition in his power, whatever
might be the consequences," because, in his opinion,
"such a settlement struck at the root of the North-West
company, which it was intended to ruin."<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>By way of argument, this gentleman took it upon himself
to inform the Hudson's Bay Company that the proposed
settlement was foredoomed to destruction, inasmuch as it
"must at all times lie at the mercy of the Indians," who
would not be bound by treaties, and that "one North-West
Company's interpreter would be able at any time to set the
Indians against the settlers and destroy them."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Defections
from the
North-West
Company.</p>

<p>Selkirk was now informed that there were several clerks
who had been many years in the service of the Northmen,
and who were disaffected in that service. They grumbled at
not having been sooner promoted to the proprietary&mdash;that the
claims of the old and faithful were too often passed over for
those of younger men of little experience, because they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
related to the partners. The Earl was not slow to avail himself
of this advantage. It became a matter of importance to
persuade as many as possible of these dissatisfied spirits to
join his scheme, by the offer of large salaries,
and several accepted his offer with alacrity.
Amongst the most enterprising was one Colin
Robertson, a trader who had often ventured his
life amongst the tribes and half-breeds, to forward
the interests of his establishment. He possessed a
perfect knowledge of the interior and of the fur-trade, and to
him Lord Selkirk entrusted the chief management of the
latter for the Company. Robertson was well convinced of
the superiority of the Canadian voyageurs over the Orkneymen,
in the management of canoes, for example, and he
proceeded to engage a number of them in Montreal at a
much higher wage than they had received hitherto.</p>

<p>To Robertson's counsels must be ascribed much of the
invigoration which now began to mark the policy of the Company.
His letters to the Company were full of a common-sense
and a fighting spirit. "Let us carry the trade to
Athabasca," he said; and he proceeded to demonstrate how
all rivalry could be annihilated. The strength and weakness
of his rivals were familiar to him, and he was well aware how
much depended on the Indians themselves. They could and
would deal with whom they chose; Robertson determined
they should deal henceforth, not with the North-West, but
with the Hudson's Bay Company.</p>

<p>The Northmen had been for years continually pressing to
the West. They were doing a thriving trade on the Columbia
River, in Oregon, where they had a lucrative post; they had
a post to the south of that in California, and to the north as
far as New Archangel. In the second decade of the century
the North-West Association had over three hundred Canadians
in its employ on the Pacific slope, sending three or four
ships annually to London by way of Cape Horn. In 1810
they had a competitor in the post of Astoria, founded by
John Jacob Astor, a fur-monopolist of New York. Astor had
made overtures to the North-West partners, which had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
declined; whereupon he induced about twenty Canadians to
leave them and enter his service. He despatched two expeditions,
one overland and the other by sea, around Cape Horn.
But the founder of Astoria had not foreseen that the breaking
out of war between Great Britain and America would upset all
his plans. Fort Astoria, in the fortunes of war, changed hands
and became Fort George; and although the post was, by the
Treaty of Ghent, restored, the Canadians and Scotchmen had
returned to their old employers and interests. In a few years
the Hudson's Bay Company was to control the chief part of
the fur-trade of the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>None of the Company's servants had yet penetrated as far
west as Athabasca. Yet it was the great northern department
of Rupert's Land&mdash;a country which, if not flowing with
milk and honey, swarmed with moose and beaver. To
Athabasca, therefore, Robertson went.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Company
in Athabasca.</p>

<p>This first expedition was highly successful. Never had
the natives received such high prices for their furs. Seduced
from their allegiance to the Northmen, and dimly recalling
the tales of their sires, regarding whilom
journeys to the posts of the Great Company,
they rallied in scores and hundreds round its
standard. The news spread far and wide.
Other tribes heard and marvelled. They, too, had listened to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
stories of the white traders, who far away, past rivers and
plain and mountain, sat still in their forts and waited for the
Red man to bring them furs. Now the Mountain was coming
to Mahomet. Many of them resolved to keep their furs until
the traders from the Bay came amongst them, too; and,
gnashing their teeth, the Northmen were compelled to give
them still higher prices, if they would obtain the goods of
the savages, and secure their wavering loyalty.</p>

<p>Other measures became incumbent upon them to perform.
They were obliged to send double the quantity of merchandise
into the interior, and they were also to supply extra
provisions to their own men, and to raise their wages; while
several clerks were elected partners. Cost what it might, the
Northmen were determined to fight to the end.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span></p>

<p>It has been shewn in preceding pages how the step of
removing from Grand Portage had been anticipated as far
back as 1785, when Edward Umfreville was sent to reconnoitre
a site for a new fort on British territory. None appeared more
suited to the purposes of the Nor'-Westers than this; the
river was deep and of easy access, and offered a safe harbour
for shipping. On the other hand, it was situated in low,
swampy soil; but by dint of great labour and perseverance
they succeeded in draining the marshes and in converting
to solidity the loose and yielding soil, accomplishing on a
small scale much of what Czar Peter was obliged to do on
a large scale with the foundation of Petersburg.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Fort
William.</p>

<p>When all was finished, Fort William as it was called,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
presented an engaging exterior. It possessed the appearance
of a fort, having a palisade fifteen feet high, while
the number of dwellings it enclosed, gave it, from a distance,
the appearance of a charming village. In the centre
of the spacious enclosure rose a large wooden building,
constructed with considerable pretensions to elegance, a
long piazza or portico, at an elevation of five feet from
the ground and surmounted by a balcony, fronting the building
its entire length. The great hall or saloon was situated
in the middle of this building. At each extremity of this
apartment were two rooms, designed for the use
of the two principal agents, and the steward
and his staff, the last named official being a
highly important personage. The kitchen and
servants' rooms were in the basement. On either side of
the main edifice was another of similar but less lofty
extent, each divided by a corridor running through its
length and containing a dozen cosy bedrooms. One
was destined for the wintering partners, the other for the
clerks. On the east of the square stood another building
similar to the ones named, and applied to the same purpose;
also a warehouse, where the furs were inspected and packed
for shipment. In the rear of these were the lodging house of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
the guides, another fur warehouse, and lastly, a powder magazine,
a substantial structure of stone with a metal roof. A
great bastion, at an angle of the fort, commanded a view of
Lake Superior. There were other buildings to the westward,
stores, a gaol, workshops of the carpenter, cooper, blacksmith
and tinsmith, with spacious yards for the shelter, repair and
construction of canoes. Near the gate of the fort, which faced
the south, were the quarters of the physician and the chief
clerks, and over the gates was a guard-house. The river
being of considerable depth at the entrance, the Company
had a wharf built extending the whole length of the fort,
for the discharge of the vessels it maintained on the lake, and
for the transport of its furs from Fort William to Sault Ste.
Marie or merchandise and provisions from the latter place to
Fort William. The land behind the fort and on both sides
was cleared and under cultivation.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The immigrants
at
Red River.</p>

<p>At the beginning of spring the "first brigade" of immigrants
resumed its journey to the Red River Valley, arriving
at what is now known as Point Douglas, late in August, 1812.
Hardly had they reached this spot than they were immediately
thrown into the greatest fright and disorder. A band of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
armed men, painted, disfigured and apparelled like savages,
confronted this little band of colonists and bade them halt.
They were told briefly that they were unwelcome visitors in
that region, and must depart. The colonists
might have been urged to make a stand, but
to the terrors of hostile Indian and half-breed
was added that of prospective starvation, for
none would sell them provisions thereabouts. The painted
warriors, who were North-West company Métis in disguise,
urged them to proceed to Pembina, where they would be
unharmed, and offered to conduct them there. They acquiesced,
and the pilgrimage, seventy miles farther on, was
resumed. At Pembina they passed the winter in tents,
according to the Indian fashion, subsisting on the products of
the chase, in common with the natives.</p>

<p>When spring came it was decided to again venture to plant
the colony on the banks of the Red River. Means were
found to mollify their opponents, and log-houses were built,
and patches of prairie sown with corn. A small quantity
of seed wheat, obtained at Fort Alexander, yielded them
handsome returns at harvest time and the lot of the settlers
seemed brighter; but nevertheless they decided to repair to
Pembina for the winter, and saving their corn, live by hunting
until the spring.</p>

<p>While affairs were thus proceeding with the colonists, Lord
Selkirk, in 1813, paid a visit to Ireland, where he secured a
large number of people as servants for the fur-trade and the
colony, in addition to those engaged in the Highlands.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Selkirk infused new life into the Company, and a number
of plans for its prosperity emanated from his brain. For a
long time the Company had had much at heart the erection
of a new factory in place of York Factory, but they had
not thitherto had sufficient strength of hands to accomplish
this. Selkirk wrote to McDonnell that if the settlers were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
employed in that object for the winter, the Company stood
ready to pay their wages. "Perhaps," he added, "it would be
more advisable to do this than to make an abortive attempt
to reach the interior.... I believe that I mentioned that
I am anxious to have the soundings of Nelson River taken,
from Seal Island down to the open sea. I beg that while you
are at York, you will try to induce some of the officers of the
ships to go and make the survey. I will pay a handsome
premium to the individual who accomplishes it."</p>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">Irish colonists
brought out.</p>

<p>On June 28, the Company's ships, the <i>Prince of Wales</i> and
the <i>Eddystone</i>, sailed out of the little harbour of Stromness.
They were accompanied by two other vessels, one a brig
bound for the Moravian missions on the Labrador coast, and
the other his Majesty's sloop of war <i>Brazen</i>,
as armed convoy. The voyage was by no
means as monotonous as such voyages usually
were. On board the <i>Prince of Wales</i>, typhoid
fever of a virulent character broke out, causing a panic
and a number of deaths, marine funerals being a daily
occurrence. As for the <i>Eddystone</i>, an insurrection occurred;
during which the sailors and passengers between decks sought
to obtain possession of the ship and dispose of her, together
with cargo and effects to France or Spain, or to the ships or
colonies of those hostile countries. The captain was, however
informed of the plan, and immediately placed armed men
to guard the hatches, loaded the quarter gun with grape shot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
and coolly awaited the advent on deck of the conspirators.
These appeared in due course, but were quick to perceive
themselves completely non-plussed and retired below in
confusion.</p>

<p>On the 12th of August the little fleet found an anchorage
in Churchill River, in close proximity to the new fort Prince
of Wales. Here the immigrants were landed, and after a
short rest were sent forward, some on foot and others by boat,
to a place known as Colony Creek. Here they built log
cabins, and in their weak, unacclimatized state, drew together
to pass the winter in those hyperborean regions. In order to
receive the scant rations dealt out to them by the Company
at the fort, they were obliged to perform a journey of thirty
miles on snowshoes each week. But the trials and hardships
of the poor wanderers, amongst which was the deprivation of
the locks of their guns "in order that they should not kill the
Company's partridges," came to an end in April, when their
gun-locks were restored and they took up their journey to
York Factory, slaying innumerable game as they went.
Here they met from the Chief Factor, Cook, a hospitable
reception, and continuing their journeyings after a short
halt, reached Fort Douglas in the early autumn. Governor
McDonnell welcomed the members of this second brigade
and proceeded to allot to each head of a family one hundred
acres of land and an Indian pony. A few days later they
were called together, and after each had been regaled with
a glass of spirits, he was furnished with a musket, bayonet
and ammunition. They were told they must offer an armed
resistance to their tormentors and aggressors should they
again appear, and admonished that the strong could dictate
to the weak. Notwithstanding, the colonists could not but
marvel at the plentiful lack of preparation for the agricultural
pursuits which they had intended to follow in this remote
region. There were no farm implements, nor was there metal
of which these could be fashioned, unless it was the formidable
battery of field-guns, or the plentiful supply of muskets
and bayonets. At Fort Douglas, under the circumstances, the
colonists could remain but a short time; it was necessary for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
them to resort, as their forerunners had done, to Pembina, so
as to be within convenient distance of the buffalo.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0416" id="im_0416"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fort Douglas, Red River.</span><br />
(<i>From a drawing by Lord Selkirk.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>In the spring of 1814, the colonists, after a winter rendered
miserable by the jealousy and unfriendliness of the Indians
and half-breeds, returned to Red River in a state of great
destitution, resolved never to return again to Pembina, no
matter what their circumstances.</p>

<p>But a step had been taken during that winter by Governor
McDonnell which was to reverberate throughout the English-speaking
world. Incensed at the boycotting of the colonists
and stirred to action by their condition, he issued from Fort
Daer, which was the Company's post erected at Pembina, the
following proclamation:</p>

<p class="sidenote">Governor
McDonnell's
proclamation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Whereas, the Right Honourable Thomas, Earl of Selkirk, is anxious to
provide for the families at present forming settlements on his lands at
Red River and those on the way to it, passing the winter at York and
Churchill Forts in Hudson's Bay, as also those who are expected to
arrive next autumn, rendering it a necessary and indispensable part of my
duty to provide for their support. In the yet uncultivated state of the
country, the ordinary resources derived from the buffalo and other wild
animals hunted within the territory, are not deemed more than adequate
for the requisite supply.</p>
<p>
Whereas, it is hereby ordered that no person trading furs or provisions
within the territory for the Honourable the Hudson's Bay Company,
or the North-West Company, or any individual or unconnected
traders or persons whatever, shall take any provisions,
either of flesh, fish, grain or vegetables, procured or raised
within the said territory, by water or land carriage, for
one twelvemonth from the date hereof, save and except
what may be judged necessary for the trading parties at
this present time within the territory, to carry them to their respective
destinations; and who may, on due application to me, obtain a license
for the same.</p>

<p>The provisions procured and raised as above shall be taken for the
use of the colony; and that no loss shall accrue to the parties concerned,
they will be paid for by British bills at the customary rates. And be it
hereby further made known that whosoever shall be detected in attempting
to convey out, or shall aid or assist in carrying out, or attempting
to carry out, any provisions prohibited as above, either by water or land,
shall be taken into custody and prosecuted as the laws in such cases
direct; and the provisions so taken, as well as any goods and chattels, of

what nature soever, which may be taken along with them, and also the
craft, carriages and cattle instrumental in conveying away the same to
any part out to any settlement on Red River, shall be forfeited.</p>

January, 1814.</p>

</div>

<p>A copy of this proclamation was despatched in all haste
to Fort William, where the partners met in the spring.
It excited the greatest indignation and bitterness. It was
now determined to seduce and inveigle away as many of
the colonists as could be induced to join the North-West
standard, and after they should have thus diminished their
means of defence, to exhort the Indians of Lac Rouge, Fond
du Lac and other places, to rise and destroy the settlement.
It was likewise their avowed intention to seize the Governor
and carry him to Montreal as a prisoner, by way of degrading
the authority under which the colony was established, in the
eyes of the natives of that country.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Hostilities
planned by
the North-West
concern.</p>

<p>Among the partners of the North-West concern who
received their instructions from this general annual meeting
at Fort William, were Duncan Cameron and Alexander
McDonell, and these were the persons selected by the partnership
to superintend and execute the plans entered into
against the Red River colony. On the 5th of August the last
named person wrote to a fellow-partner at Montreal from one
of the portages lying between Lake Superior
and the place of his winter destination in the
interior, to which he was then proceeding:
"You see myself, and our mutual friend, Mr.
Cameron, so far on our way to commence open
hostilities against the enemy in Red River. Much is expected
from us, and if we believe some&mdash;perhaps too much. One
thing is certain, that we will do our best to defend what we
consider our rights in the interior. Something serious will
undoubtedly take place. Nothing but the complete downfall
of the colony will satisfy some, by fair or foul means&mdash;a most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
desirable object if it can be accomplished. So here is at
them, with all my heart and energy."</p>

<p>McDonell and his co-partner accordingly proceeded
towards their destination, and arrived about the end of
August at a trading post (called by them Fort Gibraltar)
belonging to the North-West concern, situated at the
Forks, within half a mile of the Red River settlement.
Cameron remained here during the winter, while his partner,
McDonell, proceeded farther into the interior, returning in
the month of May with a party of Cree Indians from a considerable
distance, for a purpose which is now obvious.</p>

<p>Cameron, to whom his associates appear to have confided
the task of opposing, upon the spot, the further progress of
colonization, was well qualified to perform such a service.
He began by ingratiating himself amongst several of the heads
of families in the settlement, and being able to converse with
many of them in their native Gaelic tongue, by degrees he
gained their confidence and good opinions. He frequently
invited them to his house, and, in short, took every means to
secure their favour. They saw no reason to suspect his intentions;
and thus the influence which he gradually acquired
over many of their members, during the autumn and winter,
was artfully exerted to make them discontented alike with
their situation, their officers, and their prospects. He alarmed
them with constant reports which he stated he had received
from the interior, that the Indians from a distance were
coming in the spring to attack them; and that unless they
placed themselves under the protection of the North-West
Company, and accepted his offers to take them to Canada,
they would never be able to escape from the country or avoid
the dangers surrounding them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The North-West
company
causes
discontent
among
the settlers.</p>

<p>Prior to the departure of Cameron and McDonell from
Fort William for Red River, they had adopted the expedient
of providing themselves with British military uniforms. A
military coat with a pair of epaulets, the cast-off uniform of a
major, which had previously adorned the person of a factor
named McLeod, now added to Cameron's dignity. He pretended
to bear the King's commission, as did also his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
companion; and these two worthies occasionally rode around
the country in uniform, attended by a numerous
suite of clerks and half-breeds, and other servants
of the North-West company on horseback.
Such imposture and assumed airs of
authority would have evoked merely contempt
or laughter, but under the circumstances had
great weight with the ignorant settlers, who could not but help
believing that Cameron and his followers were sanctioned by
Government in their position and behaviour. The North-West
agents now proceeded to put their plans into execution.
The immigrants were alternately bribed, cajoled and
threatened into abandoning their settlement on the Red
River. To each Cameron engaged to give a free passage
to Canada (generally to Montreal), a twelvemonth's supply
of provisions <i>gratis</i> for themselves and families, while various
sums, varying from £15 to £100, were paid or promised to
deserters. A pretext being found, Spencer, the sheriff of the
colony and a really valuable officer, was taken prisoner under
a warrant from a North-West partner, and after a protracted
detention sent overland to Montreal.</p>

<p>During the interval between the autumn of 1814 and the
spring of 1815, a number of the settlers were seduced and
instigated to disloyalty against their benefactors and the
Company. A large band of the Bois-Brulés were, during this
period, maintained and paraded in arms under Cameron, who,
now that the preparatory measures had reached this stage,
believed the time ripe for more decisive measures.</p>

<p>Of the ruling spirit amongst the half-breed hordes, mention
has already been made. Cuthbert Grant now appeared on
the scene and with him some of his choicest dare-devil crew.
The return of the settlers to the colony had filled the minds
of the Bois-Brulés with rage. The contempt of the wild
hunters of the plains for the peaceful tillers of the soil was
great. They scorned them for their manual labour; they
reproachfully termed them "the workers in gardens," and the
phrase, "pork-eaters," formerly applied to the voyageurs east
of Fort William, was now used derisively to the Scotch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
settlers. All now looked forward to a grand gathering in the
spring at "The Forks," to administer a final blow to the
infant colony.</p>

<p>The disaffected settlers were therefore, during the temporary
absence of a number of those who still continued faithful
to their contracts and their duty, incited to rob and pillage a
fort belonging to the settlement, and of the cannon set out
by the British Government for its defence. Armed sentinels
were placed at different doors to prevent opposition, while a
part of the Bois-Brulés and servants of the Nor'-Westers,
under the command of Cameron, were stationed in arms
within the distance of a few hundred feet for the purpose of
giving support to the plunderers in case their force should be
insufficient. Nine pieces of artillery were thus taken from the
settlement and delivered to the North-West party in waiting,
who received them with shouts of triumph and conveyed
them to their headquarters, Fort Gibraltar. To celebrate this
exploit Cameron gave a ball and entertainment to the parties
engaged, on the following evening.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Attack on the
settlement.</p>

<p>A camp was now established at a place called Frog Plain,
about four miles below the settlement, by the servants and
partisans of the North-Westers, under the command of
McDonell. In June, 1815, after the colony had been thereby
deprived of the means of defence, and was in great measure
surrounded by its enemies, the whole force of Cameron's post,
consisting of half-breeds, servants and North-West clerks,
sallied forth to make a combined attack on the
settlement. A sharp fire of musketry was kept
up for some time on the Governor's house and
adjacent buildings. In this attack only four persons belonging
to the settlement were wounded, but one died soon after.
Several days passed, the men encamped at Frog Plain received
orders to march to the settlement, where they erected
a battery against the building called the Government House,
on which they planted a portion of the cannon previously
taken. After a series of attacks and skirmishes, Governor
McDonnell was obliged to surrender himself as a prisoner,
and under a warrant from a partner in the North-West company,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
sent to Montreal, charged with an undue arrogance of
authority to the detriment of the fur-trade.</p>

<p>But the North-Westers were not yet satisfied. The principal
person of the settlement (and one who also held the
appointment, from the Hudson's Bay Company, of Governor
of the district) was, it is true, in custody; but having got
possession of him, peremptory orders were issued to Cameron
directing the remaining settlers to leave the Red River. The
most wanton acts of aggression followed on the part of
Alexander McDonell, who, after Cameron's departure with
his prisoner, succeeded to the command at the Forks. The
colonists were frequently fired on; the farm-house was broken
open and pillaged; a number of farm labourers were
arrested; horses were stolen and cattle driven away. On
the 22nd of June, another attack with fire-arms was made
upon the Governor's house, but the fire was not returned by
the dispirited settlers, who now resolved to migrate.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Forced departure
of the
colonists.</p>

<p>An episode occurring on the very eve of their departure
showed clearly upon whose side the Indians of the interior
were disposed to range themselves. Two Saulteaux chiefs,
with about forty warriors of that nation, arrived at the settlement.
Learning the condition of affairs they went over to
the North-Westers' fort, and endeavoured to prevail upon
McDonell to cease his persecution and allow the colonists to
remain. Naturally, their request was refused,
although the Indian numbers prevented the
North-West official from laughing in their faces.
To McLeod, the Hudson's Bay factor at Fort
Douglas, the Indians expressed their regret; but considering
the armament at the disposal of their foes, could offer them
merely the protection of an escort down the river to Lake
Winnipeg. The offer was thankfully accepted, and under
their Indian escort, the officers and remaining settlers,
amounting to about sixty, quitted the settlement, leaving
McLeod and three clerks behind. Having in this manner
quitted their homes, they proceeded in canoes to the mouth
of the Red River, crossed Lake Winnipeg and took up a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
abode at a trading-post on Jack River belonging to the
Hudson's Bay Company.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0424" id="im_0424"></a>
<img src="images/im_0424.jpg" width="550" height="373" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Fur Loft at a Hudson's Bay Post.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The day following their departure, a party of North-West
company clerks, servants and half-breeds gathered at the
spot, and setting fire to the houses, the mill and the other
buildings, burned them to the ground.</p>

<p>Great joy filled the breasts of the North-Westers assembled
at Fort William when these brave tidings were conveyed
to their ear. These tidings were accompanied by convincing
proofs of the great victory gained over the enemy, in
the persons of one hundred and thirty-four settlers, including
men, women and children. They arrived about the end of
July and found many of the partners gathered to receive
them. The conduct of Cameron and McDonell met with
the most enthusiastic approval. They were again appointed
to command at the same stations in the interior,
which they had charge of the previous season, with a view to
oppose any further attempt to restore the scattered colony on
Red River.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Treachery
rewarded.</p>

<p>While, however, these marks of approbation were lavished
upon the heroes of this work of destruction, the subordinate
agents were by no means so liberally rewarded as they had
reason to expect. They even complained of being defrauded
of their promised hire. Many of the deserters from the
colony, however, and those of the settlers whose treachery
had proved most useful to the Montreal Company, were well
rewarded for their services. One of the most interesting
features of this business well deserves to be rescued from
oblivion. It is the account-book captured in the following
year by Lord Selkirk, together with other papers and effects
of the North-West Company at Fort William, and despatched
for safe-keeping to Hudson's Bay House, in
London. It shows that credits were given to
forty-eight of these persons for various articles
which they had plundered from the settlement and delivered
to Cameron at Fort Gibraltar. These consisted principally of
implements of husbandry, working tools, horses, muskets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
guns, pistols, etc., etc. Thus in one of the pages appears a
credit "for five new guns, £10; for a new common pistol, 15s.;
one old gun, 15s.," etc., etc. At the bottom of these accounts
were generally added the amounts they were to receive,
and did receive, as rewards for their services against the
settlement. Several thus obtained larger sums than, in all
probability, they had ever been possessed of at any one period
in the course of their lives. To many of their accounts were
also subjoined, in the handwriting of Cameron and McDonell,
brief abstracts of the services which these deserters had,
respectively, performed in promoting the destruction of the
settlement.</p>

<p>As an illustration of this, honourable mention is made of one
of them (in the handwriting of Cameron) in this style: "This
man joined our people in February, was a great partisan and
very useful to us ever since, and deserves something from the
North-West company, say five or six pounds." Of another,
"This man was also a great partisan of ours, and made himself
very useful to us; he lost his three years' earnings with
the Hudson's Bay Company for joining us, and he deserves,
at least, about £20." Of another (inscribed by Alexander
McDonell): "He was very desperate in our cause this spring
and deserves three or four pounds." There are other entries,
as follows: "An active, smart fellow. Left the Hudson's
Bay Company in April last&mdash;a true partisan, steady and
brave. Took a most active part in the campaign this spring,
and deserves from £15 to £20. He has lost about £20 by
leaving the Hudson's Bay Company a month before the
expiration of his contract."</p>

<p>"This man left the Hudson's Bay Company in the month
of April, owing to which he lost three years' wages. His
behaviour towards us has been that of a true partisan&mdash;a
steady, brave and resolute man; and was something of a leading
character among his countrymen, and deserves at least
about £20."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Leaves from
the account
book.</p>

<p>But the truest of all these "partisans" appears to have
been one George Campbell. This hitherto obscure personage
was accordingly conspicuously honoured, as well as rewarded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
by the North-West company. He was seated at table in
their common hall at Fort William, next to the partners, and
above the clerks of the company. Enviable distinction! But
it was but as the shadow of a more tangible
and, doubtless, to its recipient, a more valued
reward. By the direction of the partnership he
received a recompense of £100, paid to him by
one of the company's clerks. In the account-book above
mentioned appears Cameron's testimony to the merits of this
hero. "This (George Campbell) is a very decent man, and a
great partisan, who often exposed his life for the North-West
company. He has been of very essential service in the
transactions of Red River, and deserves at least £100,
Halifax; and every other service that can be rendered him
by the North-West company. Rather than that his merit
and services should go unrewarded, I would give him £100
myself, although I have already been a good deal out of
pocket by my campaign to Red River."</p>

<p>One would fain linger in the common-hall, at Fort William,
the barbaric splendour and even opulence of whose creature
comforts have been painted for us by another and more gifted
hand.</p>

<p>How deep the potations, how turbulent the revelry when
the flushed cohorts from Red River returned and took
their places at the board, conscious of a victory gained over
their hated rivals, the Merchants-Adventurers trading into
Hudson's Bay, and those miserable colonists despatched by
their Governor to begin the peopling of the West! Moreover,
tidings now came to swell their joy that the war
between Great Britain and America was ended, and so further
relieved their dread of disaster. But decisive as their triumph
seemed, it was short-lived. Even in the midst of this vulgar
wassail the despised settlers had returned, and affairs at
Red River were shaping for a tragedy.

<br />
1816-1817.</h2>

at Seven Oaks&mdash;Selkirk at Fort William&mdash;McGillivray

</p>

<p>A new brigade of emigrants had sailed from Stromness.
Gloomy and portentous was the prospect which greeted them
on their arrival. They beheld their comrades and fellow-countrymen
of the previous brigade, who had returned from
their exile at Jack River, still gazing in wretchedness upon
the embers of their late dwellings, seeking to rescue
what produce remained in the earth for their winter's
subsistence.</p>

<p>The ship which had brought out these immigrants had also
carried an able officer of the Company, Robert Semple, a
man of parts and culture, who had been appointed to the
chief control of all the factories in Rupert's Land.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Influence
of the
Nor'-Westers
over the
half-breeds.</p>

<p>The hostile feuds and lawless proceedings of the fur-trading
"partisans" had convulsed the whole Indian country throughout
its boundaries. The arrival of more immigrants only
served to add fresh fuel to the flame. It cannot be denied
that between the two rival companies the North-Westers
possessed one dangerous advantage, viz., the authority and
influence they had over the half-breeds, their
own servants, and over many of the more dissolute
Indians. "They had so trained and
influenced these," says, with great truth, one
sober trader writing of those times, "both in
the school of mischief, rapine and bloodshed, that no outrage
which the unscrupulous ministers of a lawless despotism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
could inflict was too extravagant to dread.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Posts were
pillaged, robberies committed, and valuable lives sacrificed
without remorse."</p>

<p>Instead of settling down quietly and cultivating the soil on
their arrival, all the immigrants were quickly dispersed in
search of a precarious subsistence at Pembina and elsewhere,
as had been the case with the first unhappy brigade. They
separated, to weather the storms of winter as best they might,
hunting and fishing amongst the savages, and enduring every
species of privation and suffering which fate could inflict
upon them. As soon, however, as the snows of winter were
melted, all re-assembled at the colony, and fell to with a will
to the task of tilling the ground, and sowing what, alas, the
fowls of the air were to reap.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Lord Selkirk
arrives in
Canada.</p>

<p>For a moment let us turn to Lord Selkirk. On the arrival
of this nobleman at New York on his way to Canada to
support in person the exertions of his colonists, he received
intelligence of their dispersion, and the capture of his lieutenant
and agent. He immediately proceeded to Montreal where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
he was apprised of the danger with which the new arrivals
were threatened as well as the distress which had overtaken
those settlers who had been brought into Canada. The
North-West Company had no further use for their services,
the expense of bringing them down having
already proved sufficiently burdensome. The
alluring promises made on the banks of the Red
River, of lands, high wages, practical encouragement,
were forgotten on the shores of the St. Lawrence.
Selkirk was determined upon a rigid enquiry; and steps were
taken by his agents in Upper and Lower Canada to that end.
While he was thus engaged, information arrived of the re-establishment
of the colony, both brigades of immigrants
having made a junction at Red River, on the departure of
Cameron and McDonell. Lord Selkirk, having despatched a
messenger<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> into the interior to advise the settlers of his
speedy arrival amongst them, now renewed his endeavour
to obtain from the Governor of Canada, Sir Gordon Drummond,
some small military protection for the settlers. But
his application was refused. One, if not the principal, of the
reasons being that Drummond had no desire to lower his
popularity by exerting his influence against the partners of
the North-West Company. The attempt proving fruitless,
a new resource offered itself, and this Selkirk was not loath
to seize.</p>

<p>As a result of the termination of hostilities with America,
the hired European regiments of De Meuron, Watteville and
the Glengarry Fencibles in Canada were reduced. The privates,
as well as their officers, were entitled on their discharge
to grants of lands in Canada, and in the event of their accepting
them, the members of the two first-mentioned regiments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
were not to be sent back to Europe. A proposition was put
to them and agreed to with alacrity.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Regiment of
De Meuron.</p>

<p>The regiments to which these men belonged were part of
the body of German mercenaries raised during the Napoleonic
wars. Col. De Meuron, one of the most illustrious officers,
bequeathed his name to the whole body. Though Germans
for the most part, Swiss and Piedmontese were also numbered
amongst them. While the great Corsican was
languishing at Elba, the De Meurons were
equally inactive at Malta, but in the war
which had broken out between England and the American
States there was plenty of work for their swords. They were
shipped to Canada, and in 1816, hostilities having ceased,
they were again out of employment.</p>

<p>Lord Selkirk perceived in them an instrument ready to his
hand. He sent for their officers, four in number, Captains
d'Orsonnens and Matthey, and Lieutenants Fauché and
Graffenreith, and informed them he had work in hand. They
listened and agreed to his terms on behalf of their men.
They hastened in boats up the St. Lawrence, and at Kingston
encountered twenty other foreign soldiers belonging to the
De Watteville regiment, and also victims of peace. These
were engaged on the same terms.</p>

<p>Eighty soldiers and four officers of De Meuron's regiment,
twenty of Watteville's, and several of the Glengarry Fencibles,
with one of their officers, instead of remaining in Canada,
preferred going to the Red River settlement on the terms
proposed by Lord Selkirk. They were to receive pay at a
certain rate per month for navigating the canoes up to Red
River, were to have lands assigned to them at the settlement,
and if they did not elect to remain were to be conveyed at his
lordship's expense to Europe by way of Hudson's Bay.
Whatever we may now think of the motive prompting the
employment of these men, it must be conceded that it was
effected with propriety and ingenuous formality. The men
being discharged could no longer be held soldiers. They
retained their clothing, as was usual in such cases, and Lord
Selkirk furnished them with arms, as he had done to his other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
settlers. Had there existed a disposition to criticise this
latter measure, ample justification was to be found in the
instructions of the Board of Ordnance, in 1813, to issue some
field pieces and a considerable number of muskets and
ammunition for the use of the Red River colony.</p>

<p>With this body of men Selkirk proceeded into the interior.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Fort Gibraltar
captured.</p>

<p>While he was on the march, the colony on Red River
was apprehending alarming consequences. Cameron and
McDonell, the two North-West partners, had arrived the
previous autumn and been astonished at the temerity of the
settlers at returning to the forbidden spot, and measures had
at once been taken to molest and discourage them. Thereupon
the Hudson's Bay factor, Colin Robertson, who, in
Governor McDonnell's absence, had placed
himself at their head, planned an attack upon
Fort Gibraltar, which he seized by surprise in
the month of October. He thus recovered two of the field
pieces and thirty stand of arms, which had been abstracted
from the settlement in the previous year. In this capture no
blood was shed, and although Cameron was taken prisoner he
was released upon a promise to behave peaceably in future
and was even reinstated in possession of his fort. But this
posture of affairs was not long to endure.</p>

<p>At the beginning of March, Governor Semple went west to
inspect the forts on the Assiniboine, Lake Manitoba, and
Swan Lake, leaving Robertson in command. On the 16th,
suspecting a plot on the part of Cameron and his North-Westers,
Robertson intercepted some letters, which transformed
suspicion into conviction. He therefore attacked the
North-West post, took Cameron prisoner, and removed all the
arms, trading goods, furs, books and papers, to Fort Douglas.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
He furthermore informed his enemy that being situated at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
confluence of the two rivers, the Red and the Assiniboine,
Fort Gibraltar was the key to the position, and could be in
no other hands but those of the lords of the soil. Following
up this move, Robertson attacked the North-West post on
the Pembina River, captured Bostonnais Pangman, who was
in charge, with two clerks and six voyageurs, who were
afterwards incarcerated in Fort Douglas. Pursuing his
advantage an attempt was made to carry Fort Qu'Appelle.
But McDonell, who was in command there, displayed considerable
force, and caused the Hudson's Bay people to retire.</p>

<p>About this period five flat-bottomed boats belonging to the
Company, laden with pemmican and from thirty to forty
packs of furs, under charge of James Sutherland, were <i>en
route</i> to Fort Douglas. McDonell was advised of the circumstance
and seized the whole, while retaining two of the
factors, Bird and Pambrun, as prisoners. A canoe was given
Sutherland and the others, together with a scanty supply of
pemmican, and they were allowed to continue their journey
to the fort. On receiving intelligence of this proceeding, as
well as of the plots being hatched by the half-breeds and
their allies in the West, Robertson concluded that Cameron
would be best out of the way; the prisoner was accordingly
sent off under guard to York Factory, from whence he
reached England seventeen months later. Here he was
released without a trial, and soon afterwards returned to
Canada, where he spent the remainder of his years.</p>

<p>The enemy were no sooner out of Fort Gibraltar than
Robertson had the walls pulled down. All the useful material
was rafted down the river to Fort Douglas, where it was
employed in new erections within that post.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Plan to exterminate
the
Red River
Settlement.</p>

<p>McDonell now exerted himself to the utmost to assemble
the half-breeds from every quarter, for the purpose of a final
extermination of the colony at Red River. Many
of these were collected from a very distant part
of the country; some from Cumberland House
and also from the Upper Saskatchewan, at
least seven hundred miles from the settlement.
Reports had reached the colonists, of whom there were, all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
told, about two hundred, that the Bois-Brulés were assembling
in all parts of the north for the purpose of driving them away.
Each day increased the prevalence of these rumours. The
hunters, and the free Canadians who had supplied them with
provisions, were terrified at the prospect of the punishment
they might receive at the hands of the violent North-Westers.</p>

<p>About the close of May the North-Wester, Alexander
McDonell, embarked in his boats with the furs and bags of
provisions which he had seized, as above related, from the
Hudson's Bay people. He was attended by a body of the
half-breeds on horseback, who followed him along the banks
of the river.</p>

<p>When the party arrived near the chief Hudson's Bay Company's
post, Brandon House, Cuthbert Grant was sent ahead
with twenty-five men, who seized the post and pillaged it, not
only of all the English goods, together with the furs and provisions
belonging to the Company, but also of the private
property of their servants, which was distributed amongst the
servants and half-breeds. The latter were now eager for the
accomplishment of their great desire. Accordingly, on the
18th of June, Cuthbert Grant, Lacerte, Frazer, Hoole and
McKay were sent off from Portage la Prairie, with about
seventy men, to attack the colony at Red River. McDonell
himself, foreseeing the issue, prudently remained behind.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>The tidings he anticipated would arrive were not long delayed.
On the 20th of June a messenger, covered with sweat,
returned from Cuthbert Grant, to report that his party had
killed Governor Semple, with five of his officers and sixteen
of his people. At this welcome news of the consummation
of their fondest hopes, McDonell and the other officers
shouted with joy. No time was lost in spreading the story.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
The unhappy Pambrun, from his confinement, could distinctly
hear the cries of the French and half-breeds, which they
caught up again and again in a paroxysm of triumph.</p>

<p>"Sacré nom de Dieu! Bonne Nouvelles! Vingt-deux
Anglaise de tués!"</p>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">The affair
at
Seven Oaks.</p>

<p>The story of this tragedy of the plains, to which for a time
was cynically applied the term, "battle," has been often and
variously narrated; but the facts seem clear enough. Semple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
the Governor, was on the point of returning to York Factory
on the concerns of the Company, when the
rumours of immediate hostility, which have been
described, checked his departure. Measures of
precaution were adopted and a watch regularly
kept to guard against surprise. On the 17th of June, two
Cree Indians who had escaped from the party of North-Westers
under McDonell, came to the Governor at Fort
Douglas, adjoining the settlement, with the intelligence that
he would certainly be attacked in two days by the Bois-Brulés,
under Cuthbert Grant, who were determined to take
the fort, and that if any resistance were made, neither man,
woman or child would escape.</p>

<p>Peguis, chief of the Swampy Indians, who came periodically
to the district about the mouth of the Red River, also waited
on Governor Semple for the purpose of offering the services of
his tribe, about seventy in number, to assist in the colonists
protection.</p>

<p>A conflict seemed inevitable. On the afternoon of the
19th a man in the watch-house called out that the half-breeds
were coming. Governor Semple and his officers
surveyed the neighbouring plains through their telescopes
and made out the approach of some men on horseback.
These were not, however, headed in the direction of the
fort, but of the settlement.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0437" id="im_0437"></a>

(<i>See page <a href="#Page_413">413</a>.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">Killing of
Governor
Semple.</p>

<p>Semple's words were: "We must go out and meet these
people; let twenty men follow me." They proceeded by the
frequented path leading to the settlement. As they went
along they met many of the colonists, who were running
towards them, crying: "The half-breeds! The half-breeds!"
An advance was made of about one mile, when some persons
on horseback were discerned in ambush, close at hand, and the
Governor, somewhat uneasy at the signs of their numbers, had
just decided to send for a field-piece, when a fearful clamour
pierced the air, and he saw it was too late. The half-breeds
galloped forward, their faces painted in the most hideous manner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
and all dressed in the Indian fashion<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and surrounded the
Hudson's Bay people in the form of a half-moon. As they
advanced the latter party retreated, and a North-West
employee named Boucher rode up very close to Governor
Semple and asked what he wanted there? To this
enquiry, which was delivered in a very authoritative and
insolent tone, Semple replied by demanding of Boucher
what he and his party wanted? Boucher said: "We want
our fort," and the Governor's answer was:
"Well, go to your fort." In a loud tone came
the other's rejoinder: "You damned rascal, you
have destroyed our fort." Semple, though a
man of extremely mild manners and cultivated mind, flushed
with indignation at such an address, and incautiously laid
hand upon the bridle of Boucher's horse, according to some;
of his gun, according to others. A few high words passed.
Two shots rang out in quick succession, by the first of which
Holt fell, and by the second Semple was wounded.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> In a
few minutes the field was covered with bleeding forms;
almost all Semple's men were either killed or wounded.
Save in a single instance no quarter was given; the injured
were summarily despatched, and on the bodies of the dead
were practised all the revolting horrors which characterize
the inhuman heart of the savage.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414"></a></span>

</div>
<p>In all twenty-one persons were killed, the remaining eight
escaping to the woods. Besides Governor Semple, Lieutenant
Holt, Captain Rogers, Dr. James White and Dr. Wilkinson,
the Governor's private secretary were amongst the dead.</p>

<p>Immediately every human being at Fort Douglas was
plunged into confusion and dismay. The survivors, hastily
returning, told their fell tale, and men, women and children
crowded together seeking protection within its walls. Bourke,
and a few of his companions, had succeeded in regaining the
fort with the cannon he had taken out. All waited for the
expected attack of the North-Westers. An anxious night
ensued, but no attack, and it was afterwards learnt that the
Bois-Brulés had a wholesome dread of the cannon in the
hands of the settlers.</p>

<p>Pritchard, who had been taken prisoner to the camp ground
of the main body of the half-breeds, now begged Cuthbert
Grant, the leader, to be allowed to go to Fort Douglas. After
securing his consent, he met with a refusal on the part of the
others, until he gave a promise to bear a message of eviction
to the colonists and return. Grant accompanied the prisoner
on parole as far as Seven Oaks, where the ground was still
strewn with the corpses of the slain.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The
Nor'-Westers
demand
evacuation.</p>

<p>On reaching Fort Douglas, Pritchard informed the unhappy
settlers that they must depart, which if they did immediately,
a safe escort would be provided them, and they
would be permitted to take all their personal
effects. They were told that two other groups
of North-Westers were daily expected to arrive
in the locality, one hailing from the Saskatchewan,
and the other party from Lake Superior. It would,
therefore, be necessary to send some of the Bois-Brulés with
them, to explain the situation.</p>

<p>At first the colonists refused to listen to these terms.
Sheriff McDonnell, who was now in charge of the settlement,
resolved to hold the fort as long as the men were disposed
to guard it. But they were not long of this courageous
temper. After fully considering the situation, the settlers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
concluded to depart, and after several conferences between
the sheriff and Cuthbert Grant, a capitulation was arranged.</p>

<p>An inventory of all the property was taken, and the whole
delivered up to the half-breed leader, for the use of the North-West
company, each sheet of the inventory being signed as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Received on account of the North-West Company by me,
Cuthbert Grant, Clerk for the N.-West Co."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Arrest
of colonists.</p>

<p>In two days the colonists, in all nearly two hundred, were
ready to embark for Hudson's Bay. Albeit they had not
been long on the voyage down the river before they were met
by Norman McLeod, one of the leading partners of the
North-West company, accompanied by a large party in
canoes. At sight of the settlers the North-Westers set up an
Indian war-whoop, and when they drew sufficiently near,
McLeod, who posed as a magistrate, is said to have enquired,
"Whether that rascal and scoundrel Robertson was in the
boats." The colloquy was followed by a seizure of the
accounts and papers of the settlers, including
some of Governor Semple's letters. Of these
they kept what they deemed proper, the rest
being returned. McLeod took his magistracy
very seriously, and seems to have regarded the whole party as
his prisoners. He expressed neither horror nor regret at the
murder of Semple and his companions, but ordered Sheriff
McDonnell, Pritchard, Bourke, Corcoran, Heden and McKay
to be arrested and put under a strong guard. McDonnell was
liberated on bail, but the others were treated for nearly a
week with the greatest indignity. Nevertheless, the North-Westers
felt themselves in a sorry plight, which, they flattered
themselves, a brazen behaviour might alleviate.</p>

<p>The five men thus made prisoners were, after various delays
and after two of them had been put in irons, conveyed to
Fort William. They had not long been inmates of quarters
at this great post, when McLeod and his party arrived there.
With him came a number of the Bois-Brulés, Semple's murderers,
bearing a portion of the plunder which had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
reserved for the North-West company. Their arrival was
the signal for rejoicing. The air was filled with impromptu
songs and ballads commemorative of the happy event,
which swept away the colony on the Red River. The "complete
downfall" desired by the North-West partner seemed
to have been consummated.</p>

<p>At that time Fort William was the great emporium of the
North-West company. An extensive assortment of merchandise
was brought thither every year from Montreal by
large canoes or the Company's vessels on the lakes, these
returning with the furs to Canada and from thence shipped
to England.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine, as one visits the spot to-day, that
it was once the abode of industry, of gaiety, of opulence and
even of splendour. It boasted a fashionable season, which
continued from May to late in August, and during this period
the fur aristocracy, the <i>bourgeoisie</i> and the <i>canaille</i>, met and
mingled in a picturesque carnival of mirth, feasting and
exultation.</p>

<p>It was the meeting-place between the Montreal partners
and voyageurs, and those who coursed the boundless expanse
of the distant west. To the wintering clerks and partners,
after their hardships and fasts in the interior, Fort William
seemed a foretaste of Paradise, and a hundred journals of a
hundred traders tell again the tale of a dream of distant Fort
William, which, in the midst of cold, hunger and desolation,
cheered the wanderer's heart and lightened his burdens. For
the voyageurs it was all in all. To reach Fort William, enjoy
the carnival, and betwixt drink and riotous living dissipate
the hard-earned wages of years was to them often the
happiness of earth and heaven combined.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Fort
William
described.</p>

<p>It was in the great dining-hall that there centred the chief
glory of Fort William. Of noble proportions was it, and
capable of entertaining two hundred persons, and here fully
two hundred sat when the news from Red River reached them.
Let us attempt to describe the scene. There on a glittering
pedestal looked down on the joyous company a marble bust
of Simon McTavish; while ever and anon the eye of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
struggling clerk or ambitious partner would be attracted by a
row of paintings, depicting to the life the magnates of the
North, and rest with ecstasy upon those gleaming eyes and
rubicund cheeks, cheerful prophesies of his own roseate future.
Not all were portraits of opulent Northmen&mdash;other heroes lent
the glory of their visages to this spacious hall&mdash;the King in his
majesty, the Prince Regent, and Admiral the
Lord Nelson. A gigantic painting of the memorable
battle of the Nile also adorned the walls.
At the upper end hung a huge map of the Indian
country, drawn by David Thompson, he who had written at
the crisis of his career, "To-day I left the services of the
Hudson's Bay Company to join the North-West, and may
God help me." On this extraordinary production were
inscribed in characters bold enough to be seen by the
humblest <i>engagé</i> at the farthest end of the great hall,
the whole number of the Company's trading posts from
Hudson's Bay to the Pacific Ocean, from Sault Ste. Marie to
Athabasca and the Great Slave Lake. Many a time and oft
while the feast was at its height and the wine bottles of the
partners were being broached and the rum puncheons tapped,
was a glance cast at some spot on that map which marked
months of suffering, the death place of a comrade, the love of
an Indian maiden, a thrilling adventure, a cruel massacre,
painful solitude, great rejoicing or a bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>But if the scene within was noisy and animated, that without
beggared description. Hundreds of voyageurs, soldiers,
Indians, and half-breeds were encamped together in the open,
holding high revel. They hailed from all over the globe,
England, Ireland, Scotland, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark,
Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, America, the African
Gold Coast, the Sandwich Islands, Bengal, Canada, with
Creoles, various tribes of Indians, and a mixed progeny of
Bois-Brulés or half-breeds! "Here," cries one trader, "were
congregated on the shores of the inland sea, within the walls
of Fort William, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Methodists,
Sun-worshippers, men from all parts of the world whose
creeds were 'wide as poles asunder,' united in one common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
object, and bowing down before the same idol." Women,
soldiers, voyageurs, and Indians, in ever moving medley,
danced, sang, drank, and gamboled about the fort on the night
when the news came of the tragedy of the Red River.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it will be remembered that the Earl of Selkirk
was on his way, with his party of about eighty soldiers, to the
scene of this rude rejoicing. When Sault Ste. Marie was
reached, the first intelligence of the massacre and destruction
of the colony was received, together with the news that some
of the settlers and a large part of the property had been
transported to Fort William.</p>

<p>Filled with indignation, and determined to demand an
explanation of the bloody deed, the Earl pressed on with all
haste to the rendezvous of the North-West company, who,
all unconscious of his approach, had made no plan either to
defend themselves or to arrest his progress.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Selkirk
arrives at
Fort William.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival in the vicinity many favourable to the
Company came out to meet him and relate the
present state of affairs. As a magistrate for the
country, he secured a number of affidavits, disclosing
such circumstances of conspiracy and
participation on the part of the North-Westers as determined
him, as it was his duty, to issue warrants for their arrest.
These were accordingly issued, first for the apprehension of
William McGillivray, the principal partner, and next for that
of all the other partners.</p>

<p>A great many of the North-West partners were at this time
assembled at Fort William, and amongst them was William
McGillivray, their principal agent in Canada. Lord Selkirk
immediately despatched a message to that gentleman, desiring
to know by what authority and for what reason Pritchard,
Pambrun, Nolin and others from Red River were detained as
prisoners in their hands. McGillivray's response was to grant
permission to most of these prisoners to join Selkirk, to whom
he denied that they were detained, except as witnesses. The
parties thus freed came over, asserting that they had all suffered
for some time a rigorous confinement. The intelligence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
they conveyed was of such a nature as to induce the Earl
to issue warrants for the arrest of most of the North-West
partners then at Fort William.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Arrest of the
North-West
partners.</p>

<p>The first to be arrested was McGillivray, who submitted
with the best possible grace to the warrant. Two other
partners who came over with him, to offer themselves on bail
(which was refused), were also taken in custody. Instructions
were now given to constables to again set out in the boats,
accompanied by some of the soldiers, to apprehend the other
delinquents. On their landing, four or five of the Northmen
were standing close to the gate of the fort, surrounded by a
considerable body of French-Canadians, Indians and half-breeds
in the North-West company's employment.
The warrants were in the usual form
served upon two of the partners; but when the
constable was proceeding to arrest a third, he
declared that there should be no further submission to any
warrant until McGillivray was liberated. At the same instant
an attempt was made to shut the gate and prevent the constables
from entering. The fort people had succeeded in
shutting one half of the gate, and had almost closed the
other by force, when the chief constable called out for help
from the soldiers. These to the number of about thirty forthwith
rushed to the spot, and forced their way into the stronghold
of the Northmen.</p>

<p>The notes of a bugle now rang out across the river. The
Earl understood the signal, and a fresh force of about thirty
other veterans hurried quickly over the stream to join
their comrades. Awed by the apparition of so many arms
and uniforms, the North-Westers abandoned further resistance,
and thus bloodshed was happily averted. The partner
who had refused obedience to the warrant was seized and
taken forcibly to the boats, the others submitting peaceably
to arrest.</p>

<p>At the time this episode was in progress, there were about
two hundred French-Canadians and half-breeds, and sixty or
seventy Iroquois Indians in and about the fort.</p>

<p>A warrant having been issued to search for and secure the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
North-West papers, seals were in due course put upon these
and guards placed for their security. The arrested men were
transported to the Earl's camp; but upon their pledging their
word of honour that no further attempt should be made to
obstruct the execution of the law, and that all hostile measures
should be renounced, they were permitted that same
night to return to their apartments at Fort William.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, it was discovered next morning that
the seals had been broken in several places, and that many
letters and papers had been burnt in the kitchen in the course
of the night. More than this, a canoe loaded with arms and
ammunition had been launched and several barrels of gunpowder
had been secretly conveyed from the fort. These
were afterwards traced to a place of concealment amongst
some brushwood close at hand. About fifty or sixty stand of
Indian guns, to all appearance freshly loaded and primed, were
found hidden under some hay in a barn adjoining the fort.</p>

<p>Owing to these discoveries, and suspecting treachery on the
part of the Canadians and Indians, the greater part of the
latter were ordered to evacuate the premises and pitch their
tents on the opposite side of the river. Having seen this
carried out, and having secured all the canoes of the enemy,
Selkirk and his party came over and pitched their tents in
front of the fort and mounted guard. Soon after, the North-West
prisoners were sent off under escort to York, and finally
reached Montreal in a state of mind not difficult to conceive.</p>

<p>Fort William had been captured by Lord Selkirk. He himself,
writing in 1817, observes, that "in the execution of his
duty as a Magistrate," he had become possessed of "a fort
which had served, the last of any in the British dominions, as
an asylum for banditti and murderers, and the receptacle for
their plunder. A fort which nothing less than the express
and special license of his Majesty could authorize subjects to
hold. A fort which had served as the capital and seat of
Government to the traitorously assumed sovereignty of the
North-West. A fort whose possession could have enabled
the North-West company to have kept back all evidence of
their crimes."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span></p>

<p>"Heretofore," exclaims the Earl, "those who in the execution
of the laws obtained possession of such strongholds as
served for the retreat of banditti or murderers, were considered
to have rendered a national service, and were rewarded with
public gratitude and thanks."</p>

<p>It can hardly be supposed that either the Canadians or the
North-West partners were animated by any such sentiments.</p>

<p>"That canting rascal and hypocritical villain, Lord Selkirk,
has got possession of our post at Fort William," was the phrase
employed by one of the aggrieved partners. "Well, we will
have him out of that fort," he pursued amiably, "as the Hudson's
Bay knaves shall be cleared, bag and baggage, out of the
North-West. And this in short order, mark my words."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Selkirk
winters at
Fort William.</p>

<p>But his lordship was by no means of so accommodating
a temper, nor was there anything to accelerate
his abandonment of the post. Finding it too
late to continue his journey on to Red River,
he despatched a party of his men in advance,
and himself resolved to pass the winter as pleasantly and
profitably as circumstances would permit at Fort William.</p>

<p>McGillivray and his companions, upon reaching Montreal,
were greeted by an assembled host of their friends. Public
opinion there was in their favour, whatever it might be in other
quarters. On all sides one heard diatribes pronounced against
Selkirk and the Hudson's Bay Company, and little sympathy
for the victims of the massacre. The North-Westers were
instantly admitted to bail, and warrants were sworn out for
the Earl's arrest. A constable was sent to Fort William to
execute them, but on his arrival found himself made prisoner,
and his authority treated with contempt. In a few days he
was released and ordered to return to those who had sent him
on his unprofitable mission.</p>

<p>Lord Selkirk was by no means idle at Fort William. He
sent out parties to capture other North-West posts, and in
this way the forts of Fond du Lac, Michipicoten and Lac la
Pluie fell into his hands. When the month of May arrived
he was ready to take up his journey to the West.

<p>Tidings of the brutal massacre of the 19th of June, and
the subsequent acts of robbery and bloodshed in the wilderness,
reached London in due course, awakening the Imperial
authorities to the necessity of at once terminating a strife
which had now become chronic. In February, 1817, therefore,
while Lord Selkirk was still at Fort William, the Governor-General
of Canada received a despatch from the Home
Government, which contained the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
You will also require, under similar penalties, a restitution of all forts,
buildings and trading stations, with the property which they contain,
which may have been seized, or taken possession of by either party, to
the party who originally established or constructed the same, and who
were in possession of them previous to the recent disputes between the
two companies. You will also require the removal of any blockade or
impediment by which any party may have attempted to prevent the free
passage of traders, or other of his Majesty's subjects, or the natives of the
country, with their merchandise, furs, provisions or other effects throughout
the lakes, rivers, roads, and every other usual route or communication
heretofore used for the purpose of the fur-trade in the interior of North
America, and the full and free permission of all persons to pursue their
usual and accustomed trade without hindrance or molestation. The
mutual restoration of all property captured during these disputes, and the
freedom of trade and intercourse with the Indians, until the trials now
pending can be brought to a judicial decision, and the great question
at issue, with respect to the rights of the companies, shall be definitely
settled.
</p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">Fort William
restored to
the
Nor'-Westers.</p>

<p>The Governor-General appointed Colonel Coltman and
Major Fletcher, two military personages of high character, to
act as commissioners, in order to carry out the Imperial Government's
intentions. Coltman and Fletcher left Montreal in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
the same month that Selkirk evacuated Fort William. No
sooner had Lord Selkirk and his party left this great trading
post than the Sheriff of Upper Canada arrived,
and by virtue of a writ of restitution took possession
and restored it to its original owners. The
commissioners, confronted by this fact, continued
their journey on to Red River, arriving at Fort
Douglas while Lord Selkirk was still in that locality. They
proceeded to execute their commission, and to endeavour to
restore the region to law and order. The merchandise, provisions
and furs were in the course of the summer apportioned
to their respective proprietors; the channels of communication
were opened, and in time the commissioners were enabled
to return to Canada, flattering themselves with the hope that
the orders of the Prince Regent would be everywhere obeyed.
The commissioners made a most circumstantial report of their
mission, of which both parties complained that neither had
received justice, which (as Senator Masson truly observes)
was a very good reason for supposing that the report was just
and impartial.</p>

<p>Unhappily, this hope of theirs was not destined to be fulfilled.
Fort Gibraltar had been destroyed, but the North-Westers
at once set about erecting buildings for carrying on
their trade. Selkirk meanwhile devoted himself to the affairs
of his colony, making provision for the soldiers of the De
Meuron and Watteville regiments according to the contract
mutually entered into. He allotted each man a plot of land
either in the vicinity of Fort Douglas, or on the other side of
the river, close at hand; and the officers were stationed
amongst them. This was done so that in case of any necessity
arising, a signal from headquarters would enable the
whole body to join their commanders in the fort at short
notice. Everything was effected which, in his opinion, could
conduce to the well-being of the colony. Selkirk now turned
his attention to the Indians, whom he called together within
the walls of the fort, and after bestowing amongst them
presents, concluded the following treaty with them:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Treaty with
Red River
Indians.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
This Indenture, made on the 18th day of July, in the fifty-seventh
year of the reign of our Sovereign Lord, King George the Third, and
in the year of our Lord, 1817, between the undersigned Chiefs and
Warriors of the Chippeway or Saulteaux Nation, and of the Killistins
or Cree Nation, on the one part, and the Right Honourable Thomas,
Earl of Selkirk, on the other part. Witnesseth, that for and in consideration
of the annual present or quit rent hereinafter mentioned, the
said Chiefs have given, granted and confirmed, and do by these presents
give, grant and confirm unto our Sovereign Lord, the King, all that tract
of land adjacent to Red River and Assiniboine River, beginning at the
mouth of the Red River, and extending along the same as far as the
great Forks at the mouth of the Red Lake River, and along Assiniboine
River as far as Musk-Rat River, otherwise called Riviere des Champignons,
and extending to the distance of six miles from Fort
Douglas on every side, and likewise from Fort Daer (Pembina),
and also from the Great Forks, and in other parts
extending in the breadth to the distance of two English
statute miles back from the banks of the said rivers, on
each side, together with all the appurtenances whatsoever of the said
tract of land, to have and to hold forever the said tract of land and
appurtenances, to the use of the said Earl of Selkirk, and of the settlers
being established thereon, with the consent and permission of our
Sovereign Lord, the King, or of the said Earl of Selkirk. Provided
always, that these presents are under the express condition that the Earl,
his heirs and successors, or their agents, shall annually pay to the Chiefs
and Warriors of the Chippeway or Saulteaux Nation the present, or quit
rent, consisting of one hundred pounds weight of good merchantable
tobacco, to be delivered on or before the tenth day of October, at
the Forks of the Assiniboine River; and to the Chiefs and Warriors of
the Kinstineaux or Cree Nation, a like present, or quit rent, of one hundred
pounds of tobacco, to be delivered to them on or before the said
tenth day of October, at Portage de la Prairie, on the banks of Assiniboine
River. Provided always that the traders hitherto established upon
any part of the above-mentioned tract of land shall not be molested in
the possession of the lands which they have already cultivated and
improved, till his Majesty's pleasure shall be known.</p>

<p>In witness whereof the Chiefs aforesaid have set their marks at the
Forks of Red River on the day aforesaid.</p>

<p class="left65">
Signed,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Selkirk</span>.</p>

<p>Signed in presence of Thomas Thomas, James Bird, F. Matthey,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the Saulteaux Indians, who were given
precedence in the above treaty, had no real claim to the lands
on the Red River, which were possessed by the Crees alone.
This latter tribe afterwards took great offence at this circumstance
and made various threats to recede from their covenant
and claim their lands from the settlers. These threats, however,
were not carried out. Selkirk having in this manner
arranged all to his satisfaction, bade farewell to Red River,
and accompanied by a guide and a few friends, directed his
course southward across the frontier into American territory.
He made his way to New York and there embarked for
England.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that his Majesty's commissioners
flattered themselves that in the formal and peaceful manner
described, law and order was to be introduced into the North-West.</p>

<p>It is true that the proclamation of the Prince Regent and
the creation of the commission of inquiry had quieted much
of the turbulence, and that all who came in contact with the
recognized officers were ready to submit to their authority;
but it was by no means so in the more remotely situated
departments.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Attack on Fort
Vermilion.</p>

<p>Governor Robertson, Semple's lieutenant, had delegated his
authority to Clarke, another ex-employee of the North-West
Company. This trader now sought upon Lord
Selkirk's authority to penetrate, with an effective
force, and a quantity of merchandise, into the
very heart of the territory occupied by the North-Westers.
One of Clarke's first acts on arriving at Peace River was
to attack Fort Vermilion, with the design of acquiring a
supply of provisions; but here he met with so vigorous
a resistance that he was constrained to beat a retreat
without having succeeded in his project. On the other hand,
two partners, Black and McGillivray, on the pretence that
Robertson had incited the savages to massacre some of their
number, and that their men would refuse to serve if an
example were not made, took him prisoner to Fort Athabasca,
and there confined him during an entire winter. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
were numerous examples of the abuse of force and the utter
abandonment to lawlessness during this and the following year.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Arrest
of
Nor'-Westers.</p>

<p>Upon most of those Northmen named in the warrants issued
at the instance of the Earl of Selkirk, it had been impossible
to serve papers owing to their absence in the distant fur
country. Williams, Semple's successor as Governor of the
colony of Assiniboia, was consumed with a desire to effect
the arrest of all those persons himself. It is possible that he
also wished to avenge the incarceration of Robertson. Taking
with him a number of De Meuron soldiers and two pieces of
cannon, Governor Williams departed to lie in ambush for the
North-Westers at a portage called Grand Rapids, which
spot it was necessary for the enemy to pass in order to enter
Lake Winnipeg. Beyond question, the North-Westers had
no suspicion of what was in store for them,
inasmuch as the party did not arrive in a large
body, but in small detachments, and successively,
often at an interval of several days.
As fast as they arrived, however, Governor Williams and
his soldiers were on the watch. It was new work to the
veterans, but they entered into it with a zest and spirit. The
North-Westers were seized and disarmed, being subjected to
considerable violence. Some were permitted to continue
their route; others were dispatched to York Factory, on the
Bay. Here they were, during many weeks, detained as
prisoners and treated with scant courtesy, up to the arrival
of a certain British naval officer. This was Lieut. Franklin,
who was then about to undertake his celebrated land voyage
to the Arctic Sea. Franklin had in his possession several
letters of introduction to partners in the North-West Company.
Under these circumstances the consideration, not to
say compassion, which he evinced for the Hudson's Bay
Company's prisoners was much in their favour. McTavish
and Shaw, two of the North-West partners, were granted
permission to return to England as passengers on the ship
which had brought Franklin, but the others were not so
fortunate. Duncan Campbell was sent to Canada, <i>via</i> Moose
Factory and Michipicoten, and there placed at liberty. As to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
Benjamin Frobisher, there was no accusation or warrant of
arrest against him, but it was felt that he should not escape
punishment for his long hostility to the Company, as well as
for the violent and crafty resistance which he had offered in
the first instance to his arrest. Frobisher is described as
being a man of great strength and herculean stature. On
numerous occasions he had had the good or ill-fortune to
come in contact with the servants of the Hudson's Bay Company,
and there were many to testify that he had on such
occasions not emerged with the loss either of prestige or
property. His whole ambition now, whilst suffering from a
severe wound in the head, was to escape from his captors.
The nearest North-West post was distant about five hundred
miles as the crow flies, but this circumstance had little
restraining power upon his project. Two of his French-Canadian
companions, Turcotte and Lépine, endeavoured to
dissuade him, but without success; and at length they consented
to participate in the escape should it be possible to
elude the vigilance of their captors. They succeeded in
doing this on the 30th September; launched themselves in
an old canoe, into which they had stored some pounds of
pemmican saved from their rations, and so commenced their
painful journey.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Flight of
prisoners
from York
Factory.</p>

<p>For two whole months these three fugitives from York
Factory travelled through the wilderness. They suffered
from cold and hunger, even devouring the buffalo skins that
the Indians had left suspended in the trees as an
indication of their route. At last the doughty
Frobisher arrived at such a state of weakness
that he was fain to lie down without further
power of exertion. The trio were then not
more than two days' journey from Lac L'Orignal, near Lake
Bourbon, where the North-Westers had a post. Frobisher
begged his companions, whose greater power of endurance
and devotion to their superior had led to their carrying him
on their shoulders, to leave him and seek assistance. This
they did, after having deposited their burden at the side of a
fire, and grilled a morsel of buffalo skin for his nourishment.
Four days later they reached the fort, and a search party did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
not arrive on the spot until the 27th of November. Their
eyes were greeted by the corpse of Frobisher, partly burnt,
and extended at full length on the ground. Within his
scanty clothing was found a journal, which he had kept ever
since his arrest at Grand Rapids, and in which he had
recorded his daily sufferings.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>After considerable delay the news of Frobisher's escape and
subsequent death was spread throughout the West. A courier
arrived at Fort William in hot haste with the news of the
affair at Grand Rapids. The utmost indignation prevailed.
Many of the partners, fearing a descent of the Hudson's Bay
soldiery, left in disorder for Montreal. The agents of the
Company instantly addressed themselves to the Duke of
Richmond, then Governor of Canada, representing to him
that if the civil authorities did not interfere to compel respect
for the orders of the Prince Regent, the fortunes of the North-West
co-partnery would suffer a great and irreparable blow.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Envoys of the
Government
enjoin peace.</p>

<p>The Duke was then at Little York. He lost no time in
dispatching one of the officers of his suite, Major MacLeod,
with a budget of dispatches for delivery at the chief forts of
the North-West. In these he enjoined obedience to the laws.
MacLeod was accompanied, at the last moment, by Sir
Charles Saxton. The envoys of the Governor reached Fort
William and pressed on to the Grand Rapids, where they
learned that Williams had raised the blockade of the river, and
had left for the Bay with his soldiers and prisoners. It was
too late in the autumn to follow them, so there was nothing
left but to arrange to have their dispatches forwarded to the
parties in the interior, and to return immediately
to Little York. The alarm of the partners
in Canada was matched by that of their agents
in London. They addressed themselves to the
Imperial Government, soliciting his Majesty's interference
in order to put an end to the outrages and lawlessness,
as they expressed it, of Lord Selkirk and the Hudson's Bay
Company. They recalled that they had often demanded that
the rights of the Company should be submitted to law, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
warned the authorities that when their rivals mocked the
orders of the Prince Regent, it would be impossible for themselves
to confide their persons and their property to the protection
of an authority with a seat so remote and exacting, so
reluctant an obedience.</p>

<p>"What is to become of us," they demanded, "if we are to
have no protection for our servants in these wild regions of
the North?"</p>

<p>"You have no right in these regions," was, in effect, the
retort of the Company. "They are vested in us by Royal
charter, and the sooner you apprehend this truth the better."</p>

<p>Whereupon the partners declared that if the Hudson's Bay
Company or Lord Selkirk continued to exercise illegal
powers, which had for their end the destruction of the commerce
of their rivals, it was inevitable that more bloodshed
should follow. Such protestations had the desired effect.
The Government entered into correspondence with the
directors of the Company and ordered that they should exert
themselves to the utmost to prevent a repetition of lawlessness,
else the consequences must be on their own head.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Trial of
Semple's
murderers.</p>

<p>The trials which took place at Little York and at Montreal
had been very costly to both parties. Those relating to the
Semple massacre were not tried until 1818.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Application
had been made to the Governor-in-Chief of Canada in the
previous March (1817) to have them removed to Upper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
Canada, and this naturally caused delay, the Governor judging
it expedient to consult the Home Government in the matter.
A favourable reply was received on the 24th of October, and
warrants under the Great Seal were issued to
try the cases at York. The North-Westers were
finally brought before the court, and indictments
found against them for participating in
the affairs of the 11th of June, and the 28th of June, 1815;
for larceny at Qu'Appelle River on the 12th of May, and the
Semple massacre on the 19th of June, 1816. It surprised
nobody in Canada that the jury in each case brought in a
verdict of not guilty, however it may have astonished the
British public.</p>

<p>McGillivray, who had been waiting two years for trial, and
now finding the further indictments abandoned, caused Lord
Selkirk, Miles McDonnell, and eighteen others, to be indicted
for the part they took in the capture of Fort William. The
Earl had also several civil suits entered against him, one of
which was by William Smith, the constable whom he ejected
from Fort William, "taking hold of him and pushing him out
of doors, and afterwards keeping him in close custody in the
fort, under a military guard." The constable got a verdict of
£500 damages against the Earl. Daniel McKenzie also
entered suit against Lord Selkirk, and received a verdict of
£1,500.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Prosperity
at Red River.</p>

<p>Whilst these various proceedings were in progress, the Red
River colony was struggling against adversity. In the winter
of 1817 they were forced to resort again to Pembina, owing
to a scarcity of food. The next year, when a considerable
area of land had been planted, and followed by a favourable
summer, the July sky suddenly darkened, and a cloud of
grasshoppers descended upon the earth. Every green thing
perished before them. In greater despair and wretchedness
than ever, the colonists again migrated across the border.
The same disaster occurred in the ensuing year, and if it
had not been for the bounty and care of the Company,
many would have perished. It was not until 1822 that the
Red River colony, now recruited by French, Irish, German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
and Swiss, as well as Scotch settlers, began to take on a
flourishing condition; but the news of this prosperity
was not destined to reach the ears and
gladden the heart of its founder. Selkirk
had reached England disheartened, and with
a well-founded grievance against the Canadian authorities,
who, he declares, and with justice, had not accorded him
the encouragement to which he had a right; and against the
Canadian tribunals, from whom it had been impossible to
obtain justice.</p>

<p>The health of the Earl, shattered by the anxieties and
episodes which have been recorded, rendered it necessary that
he should seek repose in the south of France. But his ailment
was mortal. He breathed his last at Pau, in the month of
April, 1820, surrounded by his wife and children, leaving
behind him many friends, and numerous admirers of his
intellectual qualities and his courage. The Great North-West
of to-day is his monument.</p>

<p>The death of its principal Adventurer strengthened, on
the part of the Company, the sentiment for peace; and by
removing the chief obstacle hastened an amalgamation of
interests of the rival traders. None then could nor can now
but perceive, if they examine the situation broadly, that the
complete annihilation of the North-West Association was a
mere matter of time. None recognized this more than their
agents in London, who had repeatedly made overtures to
Lord Selkirk for amalgamation, but which were by him
rejected as often as made.</p>

<p>To Edward Ellice, a leading partner, an enterprising merchant,
and a rising parliamentarian, belongs the chief credit of
bringing about this union. This young man was the son of
Alexander Ellice, a wealthy London merchant, and himself
directly interested in the Canadian fur-trade. In 1803, when
a lad of but fourteen, young Ellice had gone out to Canada,
and animated by a love of adventure, had entered into the
life of a trader, under the auspices of his father's friends.
Ellice was quick to grasp the tendency of affairs. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
terrible struggle of recent years made by the Northmen had
told severely upon them.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>The partners met at Fort William, in July, 1820, and a
stormy session served to reflect their vexed plight. Dissensions
exhibited themselves; the minority, at least, felt that
in their London agents&mdash;Ellice and the McGillivrays&mdash;coming
to terms with the Hudson's Bay Company, lay their only
hope of salvation.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Union of
the two
Companies.</p>

<p>Without, however, consulting the powers at Fort William,
these agents in London were acting on their own account.
Conferences with the Chartered Adventurers took place daily.
By the time the partnership between the Northmen themselves
expired, in 1821, the negotiations had attained the form
of an agreement. Delegates had been sent
from Fort William to confer with their English
representatives as to the future of the
interests of the North-West Company. Ellice
received them cordially in his office in Mark Lane and
showed them an instrument which he called the Deed Poll.
This document bore the names of the Governor, Berens, and
the Committee of the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company,
on the one part, and the McGillivrays and Ellice, on the
other. The astonished delegates gazed upon the signed and
sealed instrument, and recognized that the North-West Company
had ceased to exist. "Amalgamation," cried one of
them, "this is not amalgamation, but submersion. We are
drowned men."</p>

<p>A coalition and partnership had been agreed upon for
twenty-one years, on the basis that each should furnish an
equal capital for conducting the trade. This Deed Poll,
which bore date of March 26, 1821, provided that the
expenses of the establishment should be paid out of the trade,
and that no expense of colonization or any commerce not
directly relating to the fur-trade, was to fall upon the
Company.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span></p>

<p>The profits were to be divided into one hundred equal
parts, of which forty were to be shared between the chief
factors and chief traders, according to profit and loss. If a
loss should occur in one year on these forty shares it was to
be made good out of the profits of the year ensuing. A
general inventory and account was to be made out annually
on the 1st of June. If profits were not paid to any parties
within fourteen days of that date, interest was to be allowed
then at the rate of five per cent.</p>

<p>When the Deed Poll was signed, it was stipulated that
twenty-five chief factors and twenty-eight chief traders should
be appointed, to be named in alternate succession from the
Hudson's Bay and the North-West Company's servants.
Both were placed on an equal footing, the forty shares out of
the hundred being again subdivided into eighty-five shares, in
order that each of the twenty-five chief factors should receive
two (or 2/85ths), and each of the chief traders one of such shares.
The remaining seven shares, to complete the eighty-five, were
set apart for old servants, to be paid them during a term of
seven years.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Plan
of union.</p>

<p>The chief factors were to superintend the business of the
Company at their respective stations, while the chief traders
under them were to conduct the commerce with the Indians.
The third class was the clerks, who were promoted to factorships
and traderships, according to good conduct and seniority,
but whose clerical salaries ranged from £20 to £100 per
annum. The chief factors and traders, who wintered in the
interior, were granted, in addition to their share of profits, certain
personal necessaries free of cost. They were not, however,
permitted to carry on any private trade on their own account
with the Indians. Strict accounts were required of them
annually. The councils at the various posts were empowered
to mulct, admonish or suspend any of the Company's
servants. Each year three chief factors
and two chief traders were granted twelve
months leave of absence. A chief factor or chief
trader, after wintering three years in the service might retire,
and hold his full share of profits for one year after so retiring,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
with half the share for the four succeeding years. If he
wintered for five years, he was granted half profits for six
years on retiring. Retirements of chief factors and chief
traders were made annually by rotation, three of the former,
or two of the former and two of the latter. The heirs of a
chief factor or chief trader who died after wintering five years
received all the benefit to which the deceased or himself
would have been entitled had he lived, or in proportion otherwise.
Everything was thus regulated, provision was effected
for everything. The Northmen, rough, enterprising, adventurous,
as many of them were, found themselves part of a
huge machine, operated with sleepless vigilance of a governor
and committee in London. As for the profits, they were to be
estimated after the entire expenses, both in London and the
fur country, were deducted. They were then to be divided
into fifths, of which three-fifths went to the proprietary and
two-fifths to the chief factors, chief traders and clerks, who
were to be thenceforward known as the "fur-trade" or the
"wintering partners."</p>

<p>No wonder that many of the Northmen were constrained
to cry out, in the language of one of their number<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>: "Alas,
the North-West is now beginning to be ruled with an iron
rod!"</p>

</p>

<p>By the terms of the Deed Poll, the immediate control of the
Company's affairs in its territory passed from the hands of
a committee sitting in London, to a personage known as
Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land and his council. His
commission extended over all the Company's lands and
possessions, with an unlimited tenure of office. The council
was to be composed of chief factors, and occasionally a few
chief traders, who were to meet at some convenient centre for
the purposes of consultation, this particular feature being a
survival of the rendezvous of Fort William. The chartered
territories and circuit of commercial relations were divided
into vast sections, known as the Northern, Southern, Montreal
and Western Departments. The Northern extended between
Hudson's Bay and the Rocky Mountains, the Southern,
between James' Bay and Canada, including a part of the
eastern shore of Hudson's Bay.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Governor
Simpson.</p>

<p>Such a Governor-in-Chief should be a person of energy,
shrewdness and ability. Mr. Ellice had been struck by the
qualities and special aptitude for this important post of a
young Scotchman, named George Simpson. This young
man was an illegitimate son of the maternal uncle of
Thomas Simpson, the Arctic explorer. While clerk in a
London counting-house, George Simpson had attracted the
attention of Andrew Colville, Lord Selkirk's brother-in-law,
who sent him to Rupert's Land in the service of the
Company. The responsibility was a tremendous one, but
Simpson did not flinch from accepting it; and the end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
showed the wisdom of the appointment. For nearly forty
years this man stood at the head of the fur-trade: a
potentate in the midst of the wilderness, the virtual ruler
of almost one-half of a continent. Governor
Simpson was a man of small stature, but he
had "the self-possession of an emperor."<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
Accompanied by his voyageurs and clerks, he
journeyed along the old Ottawa and lake route, through
the Grand Portage, or by Fort William and Lake of the
Woods, accomplishing this feat at least once a year
throughout the entire period of his rule. At the outset of his
career he perceived that the management of Red River colony
was an extremely difficult task&mdash;harder perhaps than the
management of the fur-trade. But he attacked both with
energy, resolved to serve his employers, and to create, at all
hazards, harmony and prosperity in the territories.</p>

<p>Part of the time he spent at Red River, part in Oregon, in
Athabasca, and at Hudson's Bay. He crossed the Rocky
Mountains at three different latitudes, and journeyed extensively
over the vast territory of which he was truly the
"commercial sovereign."</p>

<p>The appointment of the Rev. Mr. West as principal chaplain
to the Company led to very great improvements in the moral
and religious life at the forts. Many of the traders and
servants of the Company were soon afterwards induced to
marry the women with whom they had lived, a material step
towards the amelioration of the condition of the Indian and
half-breed females.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Company
obtains a new
license.</p>

<p>The next step on the part of the Honourable Adventurers
was to further safeguard their interests, and supplement their
charter by a license from the new king, George IV. This
license was for the exclusive privilege of trading with the
Indians in such parts of North America as were not part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
the territories heretofore granted to the Hudson's Bay
Company. This Royal license, dated the 5th
of December, 1821, at Carlton House, was
expressly issued to prevent the admission of
individual or associated bodies into the British
North American fur-trade, inasmuch as the competition
therein had been found for years to be productive of
enormous loss and inconvenience to the Hudson's Bay
Company and to trade at large, and also of much injury
to the natives and half-breeds.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0466" id="im_0466"></a>
<img src="images/im_0466.jpg" width="409" height="347" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Board Room, Hudson's Bay House, London.</span></p>
</div>

<p>To anticipate events, it may here be remarked that this
license expired in 1842, but prior to its expiration an extension
was granted at the close of the first year of the reign of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
her present Majesty,<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> for a further term of twenty-one years.
By virtue of these licenses the Company was granted exclusive
trade in the Indian territories west of the Rocky Mountains.
It must be borne in mind, and will be pointed out in a subsequent
chapter, that it was of the utmost moment for Great
Britain to obtain a standing in Oregon and on the Columbia
River,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and the licenses were framed to this great and
desirable end.</p>

<p>Although, as has been shown, the North-West partners had
made great efforts and borne great sacrifices, to maintain the
trade on the Pacific, they were contending against great odds.
The Russian establishments at Norfolk Sound, and at other
places on the coast, even so far south as California, came to
share in a virtual monopoly with the Americans, who, after
the Treaty of Ghent, began to send ships from Boston to New
York. The amalgamation of 1821 came about, and the
Hudson's Bay Company, invigorated by the infusion of new
blood, believed it their duty to seek to regain the trade.
They therefore set to work to re-establish British influence on
the Pacific.</p>

<p>It was no easy task. The Russians had gained a firm
foothold, and the Americans paused at no form of competition,
nor any method by which they might secure their
ends. The natives had already become debauched and now
their debauchery spread from tribe to tribe, rendering dealings
with them difficult and formidable. Serious losses, both of
lives and property, were sustained through their savage
attacks on the Company's agents and trading posts. But the
work was in the hands of strong, able, and temperate men, who
knew what the situation required of them and did not shrink
from meeting it fully and fearlessly. By tact and vigorous
measures the natives were restrained; at great expenditure of
money and patience, order was restored; and in ten years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
time the Company occupied the whole country between the
Rocky Mountains and the Pacific. It maintained six permanent
establishments on the coasts, sixteen in the interior,
and several movable posts and migratory brigades. By 1835
it had a fleet of six armed vessels, one of them propelled by
steam, on the Pacific. Fort Vancouver, its principal <i>entrepôt</i>
on the Columbia River, was surrounded by large pasture and
grain farms, maintaining large herds of horses and cattle, and
was a profitable and growing establishment.</p>

<p>It was a long time since the Company had cut any
considerable figure in international politics, but with the
extraordinary growth of the American States and the increase
of the fur traffic of the Russians, contemporary
European publicists came again to speak of the prospect of
trouble over the Company's rights and boundaries.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Claim of the
United States
to Red River.</p>

<p>Before this time there had arisen a cry, sedulously seconded
by the Company's enemies, that the Red River region
belonged to the United States. Nothing can be clearer than
that it was never for a moment contemplated either by the
British or American Government, that any of the Hudson's
Bay lands, or any of the waters running into
Hudson's Bay, would be included in the lines
assigned as the boundaries between the possessions
of Great Britain and those of the
States. It is sufficiently demonstrated by the treaty concluded
with America in 1794 that such an idea never existed
in the minds of the negotiators. By the third article of that
treaty, which permits the most perfect freedom of communication
and intercourse between the subjects of both nations
throughout their respective dominions, an exception is made
of the country within the limits of the Hudson's Bay Company,
to be ascertained, of course, in conformity to their
charter from which the Americans are expressly excluded.
The terms of the treaty concluded in 1783 with the United
States show the express intentions of both nations to have
been that the northern boundary of the United States should
not, in any part, extend farther north than the River St.
Lawrence, or the lakes and streams which feed or fall into it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span></p>

<p>The unhappy feature of the matter was that a great part of
the second article of the treaty of 1783 was drawn up in complete
ignorance of the geography of the country. It is so full
of contradictions that it became impossible afterwards to lay
down a line which should follow that article literally. In this
dilemma the only fair method of solving the difficulty was to
return to the principles which governed the framing of the
article.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0469" id="im_0469"></a>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">The Treaty
of 1783.</p>

<p>At the close of the Revolution the chief aim of the American
negotiators, as is evinced throughout their correspondence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
was to obtain a recognition of the right of their country to the
western territory as far as the St. Lawrence on the north, and
the Mississippi on the west. When the British Government
acceded to this proposition it was regarded by the Americans
as an important concession, and their plenipotentiaries proceeded
upon that concession as the principle on which their
boundary towards Canada, after it had struck the St. Lawrence,
was to be defined. They brought the line from Nova
Scotia to the St. Lawrence, and then followed up the main
stream of the river to what they believed to be its principal
source, and what was supposed to approach
the nearest to the source of the Mississippi. In
fanciful conformity to this intention, the second
article of the treaty of 1783, after having carried the line to
Lake Superior, stipulates that it shall be continued onwards
through the middle of certain water communications to the
north-west point of the Lake of the Woods, and thence due
west to the Mississippi. The fact, however, is that the
waters of the Lake of the Woods feed streams which fall
into Hudson's Bay, but have no communication with any
waters which fall into Lake Superior. It is also a fact that
a line drawn due west from the Lake of the Woods would
never reach the Mississippi, which lies far to the south of such
a line.</p>

<p>But there was a reason for such egregious blundering. The
country had never been surveyed by men of science. Its
physical features had been derived from the vague and
inaccurate accounts of ignorant traders and bushrangers,
which had formed the basis for the current maps. These laid
down a large river running from the Lake of the Woods and
falling into Lake Superior. If there had been such a river in
existence, there can be no doubt, from the body of waters
contained in the Lake of the Woods, that it would have been
a much larger stream than any of the feeders of Lake
Superior. It was therefore most natural that the negotiators
should suppose the Lake of the Woods to be the main source
of the St. Lawrence. At the same time this must have
appeared to them the point at which the waters of the St.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
Lawrence approached the nearest to the source of the Mississippi,
because in the maps of the bushrangers the Mississippi
is laid down as rising four or five degrees of latitude farther
north than it does in fact, and as coming within a short
distance of the Lake of the Woods on the west.</p>

<p>As the negotiators in Paris in 1783 reposed the greatest
confidence in these crude productions of the cartographer,
is it surprising that the second article of the treaty should
be full of inconsistencies? On any other supposition
the intention of the negotiators would be fatuous and
incomprehensible.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Examination
of American
claims.</p>

<p>This brings us to the whole point involved in the American
contention, which deprived Great Britain and the Company
of a vast territory to which the United States possessed
no shadow of right. Where the limits of a country have
never been ascertained the conquest of the
contiguous and encroaching territory may be
justly considered as establishing the bounds
originally claimed by the victorious nation; and
this was the case with regard to Canada and the territory of
the Company. But where between two powers there have
been no defined limits, and no conquests have determined
the claims of either, the pretensions of both might be fairly
adjusted by laying down as a rule that "the priority of right
should be considered as vested in each, to the respective
countries, which each have either principally or exclusively
frequented."</p>

<p>The Spaniards west of the Mississippi never extended
their establishments nearly so far north as latitude 42, while
the Hudson's Bay limits were long frequented by the English.
On what ground, therefore, could the Americans, the
successors merely to the rights derived from the Spaniards,
claim all the country of the Sioux, the Mandans and many
other tribes on the upper branches of the Missouri?</p>

<p>Nevertheless the States, after their purchase of Louisiana,
continued to put in claims for a more northerly and westerly
boundary, with what ultimate result we shall see. It is only
pertinent to remark here, that nothing could be more absurd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
than the idea that Spain ever contemplated the cession of any
territory on the Pacific Ocean, under the name of Louisiana.</p>

<p>The interior river waters of the Sacramento and San
Joaquin had attracted the attention of the Company even
before the American trappers had reached them, and traders
remained there in unmolested possession long after the
Russians had left the country. The feeble frontier guard
could do nothing but protest, and ultimately when the
trappers had nearly exhausted the outlying districts and
desired to penetrate into the centre of the State, the American
Government admitted them under an agreement with the
Hudson's Bay Company, whereby a tax of fifty cents was to
be paid for each beaver skin.</p>

<p>A year before the amalgamation the north-west coast for the
first time engaged the attention of the American Government,<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
and what came to be known as the Oregon Question had its
birth. The States possessed no title to the country, but a
strong party believed that they had a right to found by occupation
a legitimate title to a large portion of the territory in
question. The matter was brought up at several sessions of
Congress, and the utmost was done by such legislators as
Floyd and Benton to flog it into an active issue. It was claimed
that "the United States, through Spain, France and her own
establishments, had the undisputed sovereignty of the coast
from latitude 60° down to 36°." A bill was introduced for the
occupation of the Columbia, grants of lands to settlers, and
regulation of Indian affairs. But the Government was by no
means so sure of the wisdom of such a proceeding; the bill
was repeatedly shelved. The restoration of Fort George
(Astoria) by the British was one of the strong arguments
used.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Russia had declared that the north Pacific
coast down to latitude 51° belonged to her exclusively. All
foreign vessels were prohibited from approaching within a
hundred Italian miles of any part of the coast. America protested,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
and between 1821 and 1824 negotiations were carried
on between the two powers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Russian
claims.</p>

<p>Russia flatly asserted that the boundary question was one
between herself and Great Britain, with which the Americans
had no legitimate concern; and offered proofs
that the treaty with Spain gave the United
States a right only to territory south of 42°.
A conclusion was, however, reached in the
Treaty of 1824, by which the boundary was fixed at 54° 40',
beyond which neither nation was to found any establishment,
or to resort, without permission; while for a period of ten
years both nations were to have free access for trade and
fishery to each other's territory.</p>

<p>In the following year was concluded a treaty between
Russia and Great Britain,<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> by which the former again relinquished
her claim not only to the region below latitude 54° 40',
but to the vast interior occupied by the Company up to the
Frozen Ocean. No objection to this was urged by America,
although some of her statesmen sought to take a hand in the
matter, and proposed a joint conference. Great Britain's
reply to this proposition was to decline to recognize the right
of the United States to any interest in the territory in question.
The recent promulgation of the Monroe doctrine had
given offence not only to her, but to Russia as well, and both
were prepared to combat American pretensions.</p>

<p>Although his Majesty's ministers had refused to treat for a
joint convention, yet in 1824 negotiations were begun in
London, between Great Britain and America, for the ownership
of the northern Pacific coast. The British commissioners
showed clearly that the Americans had no valid claim to the
territory occupied by the Company.</p>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">Temporary
arrangement
between
England and
the States.</p>

<p>The mere entrance of a private individual, such as Captain
Gray, into a river could not give the States a claim up and
down the coast to regions which had been previously explored
by officially despatched British expeditions like that of Cook.
It was emphatically denied that the restoration of Fort
Astoria, under the Treaty of Ghent, had any bearing on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
title. Nevertheless, Great Britain was willing to accept as a
boundary the forty-ninth parallel from the mountains to the
Columbia (then known as McGillivray River), and down that
river to the sea. But the Americans were obdurate; a deadlock
ensued and the convention of 1818 remained in force.
The Company repeatedly urged the Government not to abandon
one inch of territory rightfully under the Crown, to the
United States. Nevertheless, a settlement of the Oregon
Question was highly desirable. If in spite of the treaty of
1818 the States should attempt to occupy the territory, war
would be inevitable. If on the other hand the treaty should
expire without any attempt at American occupation, Great
Britain would be, by the law of nations, the
party rightfully in possession. A new conference
was held in London, in 1827; but it was
impossible to agree on a boundary, and the
only thing possible was a compromise to the
effect that the treaty of joint occupation should be indefinitely
renewed subject to abrogation at any time by either
party on twelve months' notice. Thus the <i>statu quo</i> was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
maintained, and the Hudson's Bay Company remained in
actual possession of the profits of the fur-trade for many
years to come.</p>

<p>In 1828 Governor Simpson believed it advisable to make
a general survey of the western posts, with the object of
impressing peace and good-will upon the natives, and also to
acquire a further knowledge of the needs and abilities of the
Company's officers and servants in that quarter. This journey
of the Governor, undertaken in considerable state, was from
York Factory to the Pacific. He was accompanied by a
chief factor, Archibald Macdonald, and a surgeon named
Hamlyn. Fourteen commissioned gentlemen, as the chief
factors and chief traders were called, and as many clerks,
accompanied the party to the canoes, and amidst great
cheering and a salute of seven guns, bade them God-speed.
Simpson entered Peace River on the 15th of August, and
reached Fort Vermilion in due course, three hundred and
twenty miles from the mouth, which was then in charge of
Paul Fraser. From here he proceeded to Fort St. James, the
capital of Western Caledonia, and the chief depot for all the
region north of the Fraser Forks to the Russian boundary,
including the Babine country. Forts Alexandria, Kamloops
and Vancouver were visited in due order, and in the following
year Simpson returned east by way of the Columbia.</p>

<p>In an attempt to enter the Columbia River in 1829, the
Company's ship from London, <i>William and Ann</i>, was wrecked
on Land Island. Several of the crew escaped and landed on
Clatsop Point, where they were immediately murdered by the
natives, in order that the plunder of the vessel might be
accomplished without interruption. News of the disaster
was carried to Fort Vancouver, where the officer in charge,
McLaughlin, sent messengers demanding a restoration of the
stolen cargo. In response to this request, an old broom was
despatched to the fort, with the intelligence that this was all
the restitution the Clatsops contemplated. The schooner
<i>Colbore</i> was therefore sent on a punitive expedition. Several
of the tribe were wounded and a chief shot, after which the

Clatsops entered into a better frame of mind, and expressed
contrition for their behaviour.</p>

<p>Under the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1825, the Company
possessed the free navigation of streams which, having their
rise in British territory, crossed Russian territory in their
course to the sea. The Company were not long in availing
themselves of this privilege. Posts were successively erected,
as far as the Stickeen River; but seven years afterwards
there was yet no permanent post on that stream. It was,
therefore, decided to establish one, and a brig, the <i>Dryad</i>,
was accordingly fitted out and despatched from Fort Vancouver.
But in that year, 1833, the Russian Government
had received the petition of its subjects to rescind the proviso
in the treaty favourable to the British. The Company's
enterprise in thus encroaching on Russian territory had
alarmed Wrangel, who was then in charge of the Russian
establishment<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> at Sitka, and he wrote to his superiors
urging them to memorialize the Emperor. He alleged that
the Hudson's Bay Company had violated its agreement to
refrain from selling fire-arms or spirituous liquors to the
natives&mdash;an allegation which was not founded on fact.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The <i>Dryad</i>
appears.</p>

<p>Believing that the situation called for instant action,
Wrangel did not wait to learn what course his Government
would take in the matter, but at once despatched two armed
vessels to the entrance of Stickeen River. A fort was hastily
built on the site of an Indian village, guns were mounted,
and the Company's expedition awaited. All unconscious the
<i>Dryad</i> force approached. Suddenly a puff of smoke and a
loud report arrested them, and several shots
came from two vessels hitherto concealed in
the offing. While the astonished captain and
crew put the brig about, with a design to anchor out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
range, a boat reached them from the shore, bearing an
officer in Russian uniform. He protested in the name of the
Emperor and the Governor of the Russian-American possessions,
against the entrance of a British vessel into a river appertaining
to those powers. The Company's agent attempted
to argue the matter, but his representations went unheeded.
The Russian was obdurate; they were all threatened with
peril to their lives, and their vessel, if the <i>Dryad</i> did not
immediately weigh anchor. There was consequently nothing
to do but to return.</p>

<p>The Company was indignant at this outrage. The forts it
had already built, together with the cost of fitting out the
<i>Dryad</i> and other vessels, besides a vast quantity of provisions
and perishable merchandise sent into that country,
had amounted to £20,000 sterling. The Emperor had
granted the petition of the Russian Company; and both
the British and the American Governments received notification
that the clause in the treaty would terminate at
twelve months' notice. But the <i>Dryad</i> affair took place
before this decision was made public. The British Government
very properly demanded immediate satisfaction, and
for a time public interest was keenly aroused. The Russian
Government merely consented to disavow the act of its
officer; and issued instructions prohibiting further hindrance
to the trading limits previously agreed upon.</p>

<p>The matter did not, however, receive settlement until 1839,
in which year a convention was held in London to arrange
the points long in dispute between the two companies. The
matter was settled with despatch. The Hudson's Bay
Company's claim for compensation was waived in return for a
lease from the Russian Company of all their territory on the
mainland lying between Cape Spencer and latitude 54° 40'.
For this lease the Company agreed to pay an annual rental
of two thousand land-otter skins, and also to supply the
Russians with provisions at moderate rates.</p>

<p>In the last chapter, the expedition in 1819-20 of Lieutenant
(afterwards Sir John) Franklin, was alluded to.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span></p>

<p>Franklin and his party reached Fort Chippewyan on the 26th
March, after having travelled on foot eight hundred and fifty-six
miles, with the weather so intensely cold that the mercury
continually froze in the bulb. In July, 1820, they journeyed
five hundred miles more to Fort Enterprise, where the party
wintered, Back returning to Fort Chippewyan to procure
supplies for the next season's operations. He was eagerly
awaited, and when he arrived, in March, 1821, he had a tale of
great hardship to relate. He had travelled over one thousand
one hundred miles, sometimes going two or three days without
food, with no covering at night but a blanket and deerskins
to protect him from the fearful rigours of fifty-seven
degrees below zero. In June the party started out from the
Coppermine to reach the sea, which they did in eighteen days.
Their subsequent sufferings were of the most dreadful description.
When the survivors returned to York Factory, they
had travelled five thousand five hundred and fifty miles by
land and water; but their object was still unaccomplished.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>In 1825, Franklin entered upon a second journey to the
shores of the Polar Sea, again accompanied by Lieutenant
Back and Peter Dease, one of the Company's chief traders.</p>

<p>"The Governor and Committee took," says Franklin, "a
most lively interest in the objects of the expedition, promised
their utmost support to it, and forthwith sent injunctions to
their officers in the fur countries to provide the necessary
depots of provisions at the places which I pointed out, and
to give every other aid in their power."</p>

<p>Franklin descended the Mackenzie and traced the coast
line through thirty-seven degrees of longitude from the mouth
of the Coppermine River, where his former survey began, to
near the one hundred and fiftieth meridian, and coming within
one hundred and sixty miles of the most easterly point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
reached by Captain Beechy, who was exploring from Bering's
Strait.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sir George Back, R.N.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In 1832 the protracted absence of Captain (afterwards Sir
John) Ross, who had sailed three years before for the Polar
regions, became cause for anxiety. It was decided to send an
expedition, commanded by Captain Back, in search of this
explorer, and the Government granted £2,000 towards the
expense, "it being understood that the Hudson's Bay Company
will furnish the supplies and canoes free of charge, and
that the remainder of the expense, which is estimated at £3,000,
will be contributed by Captain Ross's friends." The expedition
sailed, but after it had been absent one year, news
reached them<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> that Ross had returned safe and sound in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
England; and Captain Back was ordered to attempt a completion
of the coast line of the north-eastern extremity of
North America. The Company, through Sir George Simpson,
nominated four officers, in its service, to be placed under
Back's command.</p>

<p>In 1834 there was witnessed a confirmation of the Deed
Poll of 1821, with a more definite prescription of the duties
and emoluments of the Company's servants.</p>

<p>It was not until the year 1835 that Lord Selkirk's heirs
determined to give up their control of the Red River
colony, and to surrender the territories granted in 1811. The
expenses incurred by the Earl in his expeditions, and in his
costly law suits, were estimated at a large amount, and this
the Company agreed to assume.</p>

<p>In 1839 a powerful blow was dealt at the prosperity of the
Company by the successful substitution of silk for beaver fur
in the manufacture of hats. The price of beaver almost
instantly fell, and continued to fall thenceforward for many
years, inflicting great loss upon the Company which was
fortunately atoned for in other directions.</p>

<p>In this same year the Company, at the suggestion of Chief
Factor McLaughlin, demanded and obtained of the Russian
Fur Company a ten years' lease for trading purposes of a
strip of land ten leagues wide, extending north from latitude
50° 40', and lying between British territory and the ocean,
paying therefor two thousand east side land otter, worth
thirty-two shillings and sixpence each. Statesmen in
England marvelled at this arrangement, wondering why
the Company sought these ten leagues of Russian seaboard.
But traffic with the natives was only one of the objects of
the Company, for they also contemplated making a customer
of the Russians for European goods, as well as for
those products of the soil which the inclemency of the
more northern regions prevented their rivals from raising.</p>

<p>Acting upon this arrangement, a party was organized at
Montreal in 1839 to take possession of the leased territory.
They set out from York Factory in July, and travelled from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
thence by way of Edmonton, Jasper House and Walla Walla
to Fort Vancouver. In the following year they proceeded to
the Redoubt St. Dionysius, or as it was thereafter called, Fort
Stickine, the Russian post at the mouth of the Stickine River,
which was to be the British headquarters in the leased
territory. In charge of the fort they found a Russian officer
with fifty men, guarded by a brig of thirty-two guns. The
officer was informed by the Company's pioneers that they
would remain with eighteen men, at which the Russians
expressed astonishment. They informed young McLaughlin
and W. G. Rae, who had been appointed to the new post, that
the savages were troublesome, that the chief had many slaves
skilled in assassination and accustomed to obey his murderous
orders. To which the Company's men replied, "Other forts
we rule with twenty men, and we will hold Stickine."</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Thomas Simpson.</span></p>
</div>

<p>To this period belong the adventures and the tragic end of
Thomas Simpson, the Arctic explorer. As a youth, Simpson
had shown great scholastic promise, and seemed destined for
medicine, when fortune tempted him to try the service of the
Company. His cousin, George Simpson, was then Governor
of the Company's territories, and repeated offers of a position
decided the brilliant student to embark in the fur-trade. He
began work as secretary to Governor Simpson, with whom he
travelled from post to post for some time, until he settled
down as accountant at Fort Garry. But soon the Company
had a duty for him to perform. In order to strengthen their
hand when applying for a renewal of their general trading
license, the Honourable Adventurers decided to spend some
money in exploring the Arctic coast. Young Simpson was
requested to undertake this arduous task. Exploration
from the Atlantic showed a defined coast line to within
seven degrees of the Great Fish River, and it was to
devolve upon Simpson to explore the intervening gap.
The important duty was laid upon him of completing
the discovery of the northern coast of North America, and
in accomplishing this it was thought that the long-looked
for North-West passage would be brought to light. Simpson
set out from Fort Garry in the winter of 1836-37 and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
travelled on foot the whole distance to Lake Athabasca,
a matter of one thousand two hundred miles, where he encountered
Dease, the chief factor, who was nominally at the
head of the expedition. In the spring the party descended the
Mackenzie in open boats, coasting along to the westward until
they attained the farthest point attained by Franklin. From
here a successful journey was made to within a short distance
of Point Barrow, when their progress was arrested by the
ice. After wintering at Great Bear Lake, in the spring of
1838 the expedition again started for the coast, crossing the
Coppermine River and descending that stream to its mouth.
But to their great disappointment they found the coast ice-bound.
In the following spring they were more fortunate,
finding the sea comparatively open, and as before, Simpson
struck off along the coast on foot. The expedition returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
by way of the Coppermine and Great Bear Lake to the
Mackenzie River, and here Simpson wrote a narrative of the
expedition while waiting for the freezing up of that stream.
He departed from Fort Simpson on the 2nd December, and
reached Fort Garry on 1st of February, covering a distance of
one thousand nine hundred and ten miles in sixty-one days,
many of which were spent in enforced delays at the Company's
forts on the way. Simpson was greatly disappointed to find
on his arrival at Red River no letters from the Company in
London, inasmuch as he had offered to make another expedition
to complete the seven degrees still remaining of unexplored
coast. The Company had accepted his offer, and
wrote to that effect, but the letter arrived too late. The same
mail also contained the news that the Royal Geographical
Society, in view of the success which had attended his first
expedition, had awarded him its gold medal; while the British
Government had bestowed on him a pension of £100 sterling
per annum. Simpson's later discoveries far excelled those he
had made in 1837, and no doubt the honours accorded him
would have been very great; but in 1840, while travelling,
about three days' journey from Fort Garry, in what is now
Dakota, a tragedy took place, the details of which are still
wrapt in mystery. It appears that the party of which Simpson
was a member were arranging their camp for the night. Their
horses were grazing hard by. All were armed with guns and
pistols, for the Sioux were on the warpath. One of the party
was helping to pitch the tent when he heard the report of a
gun. On turning around he beheld Simpson in the act of
shooting, first, John Bird and then Antoine Legros, the former
of whom fell dead, while the latter had time to give his son a
last embrace. According to this witness, Simpson then spoke
for the first time, demanding if he knew of any plot to rob
him of his papers. This was the last seen alive of the Arctic
explorer; next morning his dead body was found lying beside
the others he had slain. There is little doubt that he was the
victim of a fit of insanity, superinduced by the fear that one
of his fellow-travellers might report the results of the expedition
to the Company in England before him. His death
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
removed an able and distinguished explorer, who rendered
good service to the Company.</p>

<p>In 1842 Lord Ashburton arrived in the United States,
equipped with instructions and powers for the settlement of
certain questions long pending between Britain and America.
It was expected that the Oregon boundary matter would be
one of these, but this was not the case.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the utmost excitement prevailed in Oregon, the
settlers of both nationalities claiming possession. Political
meetings were held on the part of the British, at which old
Hudson's Bay Company servants and ignorant voyageurs were
nominated for office, the latter men, "whose ideas of government,"
says McKay, "were little above those of a grisly
bear."</p>

<p>Travelling along the middle Columbia at this time was by
no means devoid of danger, owing to the animosity of the
natives towards the Americans. Their faith in the Company
remained unshaken; but they were subject to fits of suspicion
and ill-temper, which were occasionally fraught with considerable
inconvenience for the Hudson's Bay servants. In
1844, when J. W. McKay first came to Fort Vancouver, he
found that many of the Indians along the route were not to be
trusted. Early in 1846 McKay was dispatched to California
to ascertain what arrangements might be made for securing
certain supplies nearer than England, in case the Company's
farming establishment on the Columbia should be surrendered
to the United States.</p>

<p>In 1846 Joseph McKay was given the general supervision
of the Pacific establishments, in succession to James Douglas.
Taking passage northward in the <i>Beaver</i> in October, according
to the custom of the general agent, he visited the several
stations and made such changes and left such instructions as
he deemed advisable. The Russians he found "affable and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
polite, but tricky." In August, 1847, he mentions meeting a
chief of the Stickine Indians, whom he had reason to believe
perfectly trustworthy. "He told me that he had been
approached by a Russian officer with presents of beads and
tobacco, and that he was told that if he would get up a war
with the English in that vicinity and compel them to withdraw,
he should receive assistance in the shape of arms and
ammunition; and in case of success he would receive a medal
from the Russian Emperor, a splendid uniform, and anything
else he might desire, while his people should always be paid
the highest prices for their peltries."</p>

<p>In the East as in the West, at Red River, at Edmonton, and
on the Pacific, the old policy of procuring provisions and the
necessaries of life from England had been abandoned. The
Company now raised horses, horned cattle, sheep, and other
farm stock. It owned large farms in different parts of the
country, grist mills, saw mills, tanneries, fisheries, etc. From
its posts on the Pacific it exported flour, grain, beef, pork, and
butter, to the Russian settlements; lumber and fish to the
Sandwich Islands; hides and wool to England. It opened
the coal mines at Nanaimo, after an unremunerative expenditure
of £25,000 in seeking coal at Fort Rupert.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Agricultural
and
mercantile
enterprise.</p>

<p>On the Pacific Coast, as many of the Company's men who
could be spared from the business of the fort, as well as such
natives as had a leaning towards civilization, were employed
in clearing lands and establishing farms. It was
not difficult to convince these Indians that they
were pursuing the best policy, and they set to
with a will to help the white men and half-breeds,
"becoming good bullock-drivers and
better ploughmen than the Canadians or Ranakes," to whom,
nevertheless, they gave freely of their women as wives, a
circumstance which tended to promote good behaviour
amongst the medley throng of Company's servants. Such
natives were treated with all fairness, and paid wages as high
as the other labourers, usually from £17 to £25 per annum.</p>

<p>The Company became banker for the thousands who
thrived by hunting, trading, tilling or mining, within its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
domains. It issued notes, and so valid were they that it has
been said "the Hudson's Bay Company's note was taken
everywhere over the northern continent when the 'shin
plasters' of banks in the United States and Canada were
refused."<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

</p>

<p>On the 15th of June, 1846, the famous "Oregon Treaty"
was concluded between Great Britain and America.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Oregon
Boundary
Question.</p>

<p>By the second article of that instrument it is declared that:
"From the point at which the forty-ninth parallel of north
latitude shall be found to intersect the great northern branch
of the Columbia River, the navigation of the said branch of
the river to the point where the said branch meets the main
stream of the said river shall be free and open to the Hudson's
Bay Company, and to all British subjects trading
with the same, and thence down the said
main stream to the ocean, with free access into
and through the said river or rivers, it being
understood that all the usual portages along the line thus
described shall, in like manner, be free and open. In navigating
the said river or rivers, British subjects, with their
goods and produce, shall be treated on the same footing as
citizens of the United States; it being, however, always
understood that nothing in this article shall be construed as
preventing, or intending to prevent, the Government of the
United States from making any regulations respecting the
navigation of the said river or rivers not inconsistent with
the present treaty."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Hudson's Bay Co.'s Employees on their Annual Expedition.</span><br />
(<i>From "Picturesque Canada," by permission.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>According to Article III, "In the future appropriation of
the territory south of the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude,
as provided in the first article of this treaty, the possessary
rights of the Hudson's Bay Company, and of all British subjects
who may be already in the occupation of land or other
property lawfully acquired within the said territory, shall be
respected."</p>

<p>The Oregon boundary question was thus settled. Immigrants
were pouring into Oregon from all parts of America,
and California was already receiving numerous gold miners.
It was therefore natural that Vancouver Island and British
Columbia should receive attention. The climate was known
to be almost perfect, and a motion to encourage colonization
in those territories was made in the British Parliament. But
the Company was quite alive to the situation. A letter was
addressed to Earl Grey, the Colonial Secretary, dwelling on
the efforts the Adventurers had made in the British interest,
and urging that Vancouver Island be granted to them.</p>

<p>The negotiations continued until March, 1847, when Sir J.
H. Pelly, the Governor of the Company, again wrote to Earl
Grey, informing him that the Company would "undertake the
government and colonization of all the territories belonging
to the Crown in North America, and receive a grant accordingly."
Such a proposition staggered Her Majesty's Ministers,
who were for the most part ignorant of the work the Company
had already accomplished, of the position it occupied, or of
the growth of its establishment on the Pacific. Already it
governed and was now busy colonizing the territory, doing
both in a manner superior to that adopted by the Americans
in their adjacent territories. Such a proposition, too, awakened
all the jealousy and enmity against the Company which
had been latent for so long.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Enmity and
jealousy
aroused.</p>

<p>One of the most determined and virulent in his attacks
on the Company at this time was one A. K.
Isbister, who addressed a long communication
to Earl Grey, besides other letters to public men
in England. In answer to Mr. Isbister, Earl Grey
forwarded the substance of a report which had been made by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
Major Griffiths, late in command of Her Majesty's troops
at Fort Garry, to whom had been communicated the petition
of certain residents of Red River settlement.</p>

<p>To all the petitions, memorials, and complaints of interested
parties and self-seekers against the Company, Earl Grey
had but one answer. He said he had gone to the bottom of
the matter, and he believed the Company was honest and
capable. If he had had any doubt about it, this doubt must
have been removed by a remarkable despatch of Lord Elgin,
Governor-General of Canada, under date of 6th June, 1848.
"I am bound to state," he wrote, "that the result of the
enquiries which I have hitherto made is highly favourable to
the Company, and that it has left on my mind the impression
that the authority which it exercises over the vast and
inhospitable region subject to its jurisdiction, is, on the
whole, very advantageous to the Indians.... More
especially it would appear to be a settled principle of their
policy to discountenance the use of ardent spirits. It is
indeed possible that the progress of the Indians toward
civilization may not correspond with the expectations of some
of those who are interested in their welfare. But disappointments
of this nature are experienced, I fear, in other quarters
as well as in the territories of the Hudson's Bay Company; and
persons to whom the trading privileges of the Company are
obnoxious may be tempted to ascribe to its rule the existence
of evils which are altogether beyond its power to remedy.
There is too much reason to fear that if the trade were thrown
open and the Indians left to the mercy of the adventurers who
might chance to engage in it, their condition would be greatly
deteriorated."<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the opinion of the Earl of Elgin on the Hudson's
Bay Company, and it was the opinion of all who really
understood the Company's aims, its history and its position.
"Persons to whom the trading privileges of the Company are
obnoxious." It was thus that the Earl laid his finger upon
the cause of the whole onslaught. Jealousy of the Company's
rights was at the bottom of the whole matter.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Opposition
of Mr.
Gladstone.</p>

<p>The Vancouver Island negotiations were suspended for a
year, and then the Company, seeing the opposition it had
evoked, put forward a less extensive proposal,
by which it offered to continue the general
management of the whole territory north of
the forty-ninth degree, and for colonizing purposes
to except Vancouver Island alone. It agreed to
colonize the island without any pecuniary advantage accruing
to itself, and promised that all moneys received for lands
and minerals should be applied to purposes connected with
the improvement of the country. The proposition seemed a
reasonable one; but in a certain rising statesman, who had
inherited his opposition to the Company from his father, and
who had many followers, the Honourable Adventurers had a
powerful enemy. His name was Mr. W. E. Gladstone, and
his enmity to the measure caused the Government to halt.</p>

<p>The Company was not without strong friends, as well as
enemies. It drew up a deed of charter, and boldly relied on
the Earl of Lincoln (afterwards Duke of Newcastle) to
procure favour for it in the House of Commons. On the
17th July the Earl opened the subject, and drew from
Mr. Gladstone a speech which occupies many columns of
Hansard's Debates. With mighty energy he hurled argument,
invective, appeal and remonstrance at the heads of
his fellow-members. It was even suggested that he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
actuated by personal malice. Every statement, every slander
that could wither or blacken the fair fame of a corporation
which had deserved well of its country, was employed on this
occasion, and his conclusion was that the Company was incompetent
to carry out its promises. Mr. Howard, who followed,
believed that it would be "most unwise to confer the extensive
powers proposed on a fur-trading Company." Yet he
did not deny that as California had recently been ceded to
America, it was a matter of the highest importance that a
flourishing British Colony should be established on the Pacific
Coast as an offset to that power. Lord John Russell undertook
to enlighten the House as to the achievements of the
Company, apart from fur-trading. He said that it already
held exclusive privileges, which did not expire until 1859;
that the western lands were controlled by a Crown grant,
dated 13th May, 1838, confirming the possession by the
Company for twenty-one years from that date; that these
privileges "could not be taken away from it without breach
of principle and that if colonization were delayed until the
expiration of this term squatters from America might step
in and possess themselves of the Island."</p>

<p class="sidenote">The grant of
Vancouver
Island.</p>

<p>It was voted to refer the matter to the Privy Council Committee
for Trade and Plantations; and on the
4th September this body reported in favour of
granting Vancouver Island to the Hudson's Bay
Company. The grant was duly signed, sealed
and delivered on the 13th January, 1849.</p>

<p>The Company, in the midst of its triumph, was not satisfied.
It had aroused enmities which it was powerless to allay.
It had been lured, by too zealous friends, into making promise
of a policy which it foresaw could not be followed without
ruinous cost. It also foresaw that the rush to the Pacific,
consequent upon the gold-fever of 1849, would bring about
new interests not its own and, in brief, that the colony would
pass from its hands, and that all its outlay and labour would
have been expended without profits. What it anticipated
came about sooner than it expected. Opposition had been
collecting from without, and had been engendered from within.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
Some of the Adventurers announced that when, in 1859, the
grant would expire, they would object to its renewal. The
Company's enemies asserted that it had not exerted itself to
bring about the desired colonization of Vancouver Island.
The settlers forwarded a memorial asking to be relieved from
the Company's control. At the same time, the Governor it
had appointed, Mr. Douglas (afterwards Sir James Douglas),
was popular, and when the grant was allowed to expire and
Vancouver Island became a Crown colony in 1859, he was
retained in the same office. Soon afterwards, a Government
was organized, with Mr. Douglas at its head, on the mainland
of British Columbia.</p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile, in the eastern as well as the western extremity
of the Company's domains, agitation and malcontent was
being fomented. Certain residents of Red River settlement
had forwarded petitions to Earl Grey. Lieutenant-Colonel
Crofton, in command of Her Majesty's troops at Fort Garry,
was asked to send in a report of the state of affairs at Red
River. At a little later period his successor, Major Griffiths,
was requested to do the same. Neither had any connection
with the Company, and both might therefore be regarded as
unbiassed as well as fully informed. Both exonerated the
Company from most of the charges brought against them, and
as to the remainder, which were preferred on untrustworthy
evidence, they professed ignorance. They rendered full credit
to the Company "for the manner in which it has of late years
exercised its powers."</p>

<p>In the year of the Oregon treaty the Company caused some
valuable exploration to be made of its northern coasts. Dr.
Rae and his party reached Chesterfield Inlet 13th July, 1846,
passed Repulse Bay safely, and conveyed their boats thence
into Committee Bay, at the bottom of Boothia Gulf. The
Company's expedition wintered at Repulse Bay, and again
entering Committee Bay, in April, 1847, by the following
month had completed a survey, with the exception of Fury
and Hecla Straits, of the entire northern coast of the North
American continent.

<p class="sidenote">Fate of the
Franklin
Expedition.</p>

<p>In the previous year, 1845, Sir John Franklin, who had,
since his last travels in Rupert's Land, been
Governor of Tasmania, was offered the command
of another expedition in search of the north-west
passage by the British Government. He embarked
in the <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i>, and his ships were last
seen on the 26th of July in Baffin's Bay by a whaler.</p>

<p>Several years passed without tidings of the expedition. In
1850 traces of the missing ships were discovered by Ommaney
and Penny, and it was thus ascertained that the first winter
had been spent behind Beechy Island. No further news came
until the spring of 1854, when an expedition of the Hudson's
Bay Company, under Dr. Rae, from Republic Bay, received
information from the Esquimaux that four years before about
forty white men had been seen dragging a boat over the ice
near the north shore of King William's Island. Somewhat
later in the same season of 1850, declared the natives, the
bodies of the entire party were found at a point a short
distance to the north-west of the Great Fish River. To
prove their assertion the Esquimaux produced various articles
which were known to have belonged to the ill-fated explorer
and his party. The Government having previously offered a
reward of £10,000 "to any party, or parties who, in the judgment
of the Board of Admiralty, shall, by virtue of his or her
efforts, first succeed in ascertaining" the fate of the missing
expedition, Dr. Rae laid claim to and obtained this reward.
Another expedition under Anderson and Stewart went in
two canoes, in 1855, down the Great Fish River, and further
verified the truth by securing more European articles and
clothing from the Esquimaux. It now became clear that a
party from the <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i> had sought to reach, by the
Fish River route, the nearest Company's post to the south,
and had been arrested by the ice in the channel near that
river's mouth. In 1857 Lady Franklin, whose efforts to set at
rest the fate of her husband had been most heroic, sent out
the yacht <i>Fox</i>, commanded by Captain (afterwards Sir
Leopold) McClintock, who had already taken part in three
expeditions despatched in search of Franklin. In the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
year more relics were obtained, closely followed by the
discovery of many skeletons. In a cairn at Point Victory
Lieutenant Hobson unearthed the celebrated record kept by
two of the explorers, which briefly told the history of the
expedition for three years, or up to April 25, 1848. It
appeared that Sir John Franklin had perished on the 11th of
June, 1847. It is believed that one of the vessels must have
been crushed in the ice and the other stranded on the shore
of King William's Island, where it lay for years, a mine of
wonderful implements and playthings for the Esquimaux.</p>

<p>Franklin was virtually the discoverer of the long-sought
north-west passage, inasmuch as he had all but traversed the
entire distance between Baffin's Bay and Bering's Strait.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The North-West
Passage
discovered
at last.</p>

<p>Yet it should be observed that in 1853 Commander
McClure, who was in charge of an Arctic expedition from
the Pacific, was rescued near Melville Island by
Sir Edward Belcher, who came from the side of
the Atlantic, and both he and his ship's company
returned to Europe <i>via</i> Baffin's Bay. Thus
the secret of the north-west passage was disclosed
at last. It was now known that a continuous passage
by water existed between Baffin's Bay and Bering's Strait,
and that was the last of the voyages undertaken for the
purpose through Rupert's Land.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span></p>

<p>For ten years past the profits of the Company had already
increased. In 1846, there were in its employ five hundred
and thirteen articled men and thirty-five officers. It controlled
a net-work of trading routes between its posts situated
between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. In 1856 it had
one hundred and fifty-two establishments under Governor
Simpson's control, with sixteen chief factors and twenty-nine
chief traders, assisted by five surgeons, eighty-seven clerks,
sixty-seven postmasters, five hundred voyageurs and one
thousand two hundred permanent servants, in addition to
sailors on sea-going ships and other employees, numbering
altogether above three thousand men.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Imperial Parliament
appoints
Select
Committee.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1857 the opponents of the Company
were on the <i>qui vive</i>. They had at last succeeded in procuring
a Select Committee of the Imperial House of Commons
for the purpose of considering "the state of those British
possessions in North America which are under
the administration of the Hudson's Bay Company,
or over which it possesses a license to
trade." The committee was composed of the
following persons: The Right Honourable
Henry Labouchere (afterwards Lord Taunton),
Sir John Pakingham, Lord John Russell, Mr. Gladstone, the
Right Honourable Edward Ellice, Lord Stanley, Viscount
Sandon, and Messrs. Lowe, Adderley, Roebuck, Grogan,
Kinnaird, Blackburn, Charles Fitzwilliam, Gordon, Gurney,
Bell and Percy Herbert. Evidence was taken from the
20th of February to the 9th of March, which comprised
the first session of the committee. It sat again in May,
and the examination of the numerous witnesses ended
on the 23rd of June. Public interest was aroused, and the
Company and its doings again became a standing topic at
London dinner-tables. The Honourable Adventurers were
again on their trial&mdash;would they come out of the ordeal as
triumphantly as on the occasion of the previous great investigation
a full century and a decade before? The list of
witnesses comprised some of the best known names of the
day. There were: Sir John Richardson, Rear Admiral Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
George Back, Dr. Rae, Chief Justice Draper of Canada, Sir
George Simpson, Hon. John Ross, Lieut.-Colonel Lefroy,
Lieut.-Colonel Caldwell, Bishop Anderson, Hon. Charles Fitzwilliam,
Dr. King and Right Hon. Edward Ellice. At the
second session Messrs. Gordon, Bell and Adderley retired, and
Viscount Goderich, and Messrs. Matheson and Christy took
their places. The first witness examined was the Honourable
John Ross, then President of the Grand Trunk Railway of
Canada. "It is complained," said he, "that the Hudson's
Bay Company occupy that territory and prevent the extension
of settlement and civilization in that part of the continent.
I do not think they ought to be permitted to do that;
but I think it would be a very great calamity if their control
and power were entirely to cease. My reason for forming
that opinion is this: during all the time that I have been able
to observe their proceedings, there has been peace within the
whole territory. The operations of the Company seem to
have been carried on, at all events, in such a way as to prevent
the Indian tribes within their borders from molesting
the Canadian frontier; while, on the other hand, those who
have turned their attention to that quarter of the world must
have seen that, from Oregon to Florida, for these last thirty
years or more, there has been a constant Indian war going on
between the natives of American territory, on the one side,
and the Indian tribes on the other. Now, I very much fear
that if the occupation of the Hudson's Bay Company were to
cease, our fate in Canada might be just what it is with
Americans in the border settlements of their territory."</p>

<p>Lord Elgin had showed the weak spot of the opposition.
Mr. Ross indicated it more precisely. "I believe," said he,
"there are certain gentlemen at Toronto very anxious to get
up a second North-West company, and I daresay it would
result in something like the same difficulties which the last
North-West company created. I should be sorry to see
them succeed. I think it would do a great deal of harm,
creating further difficulties in Canada, which I do not desire
to see created."</p>

<p>At the close of the evidence, Mr. Gladstone proposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
resolutions unfavourable to the Company, which were negatived
by the casting vote of the chairman, Lord Taunton, the
numbers being seven to seven. The committee agreed to
their report on the 31st July. It recommended that the Red
River and Saskatchewan districts might be "ceded to Canada
on equitable principles," the details being left to Her
Majesty's Government. The termination of the Company's
rule over Vancouver Island was advised; and this advice was
not distasteful to the Company. The committee strongly
urged, in the interests of law and order, and of the Indian
population as well as for the preservation of the fur-trade,
that the Company "should continue to enjoy the privileges
of exclusive trade which they now possess."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Toronto merchants
petition
Legislative
Council.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the spirit prevalent in many quarters
in Canada towards the Company, the petition which on the
28th of April, 1857, reached the Legislative Council of Canada,
may be cited. It emanated from the Board of
Trade of the City of Toronto. After reciting in
anything but a respectful manner the history
and status of the Company, it declared that the
Company acted under a "pretended" right, that
it "assumed the power to enact tariffs, collect custom dues,
and levy taxes against British subjects, and has enforced unjust
and arbitrary laws in defiance of every principle of right and
justice." The petitioners besought the attention of the Government
"to that region of country designated as the chartered
territory, over which the said Company exercises a sovereignty
over the soil as well as a monopoly in the trade, and which said
Company claims as a right that insures to it <i>in perpetuo</i>, in
contradistinction to that portion of the country over which it
claims an exclusive right of trade, but for a limited period
only." The "gentlemen from Toronto" admitted that this
latter claim was founded upon a legal right, but submitted
that a renewal of "such license of exclusive trade was
injurious to the interests of the country so monopolized, and
in contravention of the rights of the inhabitants of Canada."</p>

<p>In this year the claims of the Company in connection with
the Treaty of 1846 were finally arranged by a special treaty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
concluded through the Hon. W. H. Seward for America, and
Lord Lyons, the British Ambassador. The Puget's Sound
Agricultural Company, which was an offshoot and subordinate
concern of the Hudson's Bay Company, for the purposes of
wheat, wool, hides and tallow production, was also named as
one of the interested parties.</p>

<p>"Whereas," so ran the new treaty, "it is desirable that all
questions between the United States authorities on the one
hand, and the Hudson's Bay and Puget's Sound Agricultural
Companies on the other, with respect to the possessary rights
and claims of these companies, and of any other British
subjects in Oregon and Washington Territory, should be
settled by the transfer of those rights and claims to the
Government of the United States for an adequate money
consideration: It is hereby agreed that the United States
of America and Her Britannic Majesty shall, within twelve
months after the exchange of the ratification of the present
treaty, appoint each a commissioner for the purpose of
examining and deciding upon all claims arising out of the
provisions of the above-quoted articles of the Treaty of June
15, 1846."<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">Unwholesome
temper
amongst the
Indians.</p>

<p>The commercial rivalry existing between the Russian-American
Company and the Hudson's Bay Company, which
held a trading lease of part of the sea-bound territory, naturally
tended to engender and keep alive an unwholesome
temper amongst the Indians. They were frequently troublesome,
and occasionally murderous. In May, 1862, between
two hundred and fifty and three hundred of the natives on the
west side of Chatham Strait, twenty-five miles north of Cross
Sound, seized on the quarter-deck the captain and chief trader
of the Company's steamer <i>Labouchere</i>, of seven hundred tons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
and taking possession of the vessel, drove the crew forward.
But the crew had a large gun trained aft, and
parleying took place. The Indians had not
known that this was a Company ship. It was
agreed that both parties should discharge their
rifles, and peace was proclaimed, the Indians finally leaving
the vessel. Before their departure, however, they covered the
deck with fine sea-otter and other skins as a present to the
captain and traders, and as a token of peace.</p>

<p>In September, 1860, after an illness of but five days' duration,
died Sir George Simpson, the Governor-in-Chief in Rupert's
Land, amidst universal regrets. He had been often, indeed
persistently, attacked by the Company's enemies during his
tenure of his office; indeed almost up to the day of his death
he was charged with being autocratic and tyrannical, but none
could deny him great ability and exceptional fitness for his post.</p>

<p>He had taken a powerful interest in northern discoveries,
and superintended the fitting out of several Arctic expeditions.
For his services in this direction he had been knighted
in 1841, and soon afterwards had set out on a journey round
the world, of which he published an interesting relation. In
his late years he resided at Lachine, where he entertained the
Prince of Wales, on his visit in 1860.</p>

<p>His successor was Mr. A. E. Dallas, who having made a
considerable fortune in China, had for some time served the
Company on the Pacific coast. Thanks to his prudence, the
landing in 1859 of General Harney and a detachment of
American troops on the island St. Juan, between Vancouver's
Island and the mainland, had been controlled and check-mated
by the proposal of joint occupation until negotiations
should settle the question of right. He was returning home
to England, intending to retire, when he was persuaded to
accept the Governorship of Rupert's Land.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Proposals to
buy out
the Company.</p>

<p>At the head of a scheme for a transcontinental road and
telegraph system was Mr. (afterwards Sir)
Edward Watkin, well known as the promoter
of the Grand Trunk Railway. For this scheme
an Imperial subsidy was sought. The dissensions
which ensued between the various parties interested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
proved not unfruitful, for they led up to the great question of
buying out the Company.</p>

<p>At the beginning, however, the Duke of Newcastle, then
Colonial Secretary, had amiably undertaken to sound the
Company as to their willingness to allow a road and telegraphs
through their territory.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>In response to this demand the aged Governor answered,
almost in terror, to the Duke of Newcastle, "What, sequester
our very tap-root! Take away the fertile lands where the
buffaloes feed! Let in all kinds of people to squat and settle,
and frighten away the fur-bearing animals they don't hunt
and kill! Impossible! Destruction&mdash;extinction of our time-honoured
industry. If these gentlemen are so patriotic, why
don't they buy us out?" To this outburst the Duke quietly
replied: "What is your price?" Governor Berens answered:
"Well, about a million and a half."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Discussions
as to
the price.</p>

<p>On hearing this, Mr. Watkin was anxious that the British
Government should figure among the purchasing parties.
Purchase seemed the only way out of the difficulty. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
Governor and Company seemed to have made up their minds
for a sale or else to withstand the project which Mr. Watkin
and the rest had so dearly at heart. An endeavour
was made to convince the Duke that
at the price named there could be no risk of
loss, because the fur-trade could be separated
from the land and rights, and after the purchase a new
joint-stock company could be organized to take over the
trading-posts, the fleet of ships, the stock of goods, and
the other assets, rights and privileges affecting trade. Such
a company, it was figured, would pay a rental (redeemable
over a term of years if necessary) of three or three
and one-half per cent, on £800,000, leaving only £700,000
as the value of a territory bigger than Russia in Europe.
Such a company would have to raise additional capital
of its own to modernise its business, to improve the means
of intercourse between its posts, and to cheapen and expedite
the transport to and fro of its merchandise. It was
pointed out that a land company could be organized in
England, Canada and America which, on a similar principle
of redemption rental, might take over the lands, leaving a
reserve of probably a fourth of the whole as the unpaid-for
property of the Government, at the price of £700,000. "Were
these proposals to succeed, then," said Mr. Watkin, "all the
country would have to do was to lend £1,000,000 on such
security as could be offered, ample in each case," in his opinion.
But a condition was to be imposed if these plans were to be
adopted. The Hudson's Bay territory must be erected into
a Crown colony like British Columbia, and governed on
the responsibility of the Empire. As to the cost of government,
there were three suggestions put forward. One was
that it might be recouped by a moderate system of duties
in and out of the territory, to be agreed upon between Canada
and British Columbia on the one hand, and the United States
on the other. The second was to sell a portion of the territory
to America for five million dollars, which sum Mr. Watkin
knew could be obtained. The third scheme was to open up
portions of the fertile belt to colonization from the United
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
States. When considering the second plan, the Duke said he
would not sell; he would exchange; and studying the map,
"we put our fingers upon the Aroostook Wedge, in the State
of Maine; upon a piece of territory at the head of Lake
Superior, and upon islands between British Columbia and
Vancouver's Island, which might be the equivalent of rectification
of boundary on many portions of the westward along
the 49th parallel of latitude."</p>

<p>As for a name for the new proposed Crown colony, Dr.
Mackay had suggested to Mr. Watkin, "Hysperia," and this
name was mentioned to the Duke. Its similarity to "hysteria"
probably caused it to be dismissed.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Opposition
of the
Colonial
Office.</p>

<p>The decision of the Duke of Newcastle on the whole
proposition was that were he a Minister of Russia he would
agree to purchase the land from the Hudson's
Bay Company. "It is," said he, "the right
thing to do for many, for all reasons; but
ministers here must subordinate their views
to the Cabinet." Nevertheless, he went so far as to believe
that it was right. But the Colonial Office were in positive
opposition to the scheme.</p>

<p>It was now clear that the promoters of the Pacific transcontinental
railway could hope for no direct pecuniary aid
from the British Government. They must act for themselves.</p>

<p>After some correspondence, it was arranged that the promoters
of the "Pacific scheme," as it was called, should meet
the Governor and Committee of the Hudson's Bay Company
in an official interview. The date was the 1st of December,
1862.</p>

<p>"The room," writes Sir Edward Watkin in his Memoirs,
"was the Court room, dark and dirty. A faded green cloth,
old chairs, almost black, and a fine portrait of Prince Rupert.
We met the Governor, Berens, Eden Colville and Lyell only.
On our part there were Mr. G. G. Glyn (the late Lord
Wolverton), Captain Glyn (the late Admiral Henry Glyn),
and Messrs. Newmarch, Benson, Blake and myself. Mr.
Berens, an old man and obstinate, bearing a name to be
found in the earliest lists of Hudson's Bay shareholders, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
somewhat insulting in his manner. We took it patiently.
He seemed to be astounded at our assurance. 'What! interfere
with his fertile belt, tap-root,' etc."</p>

<p class="sidenote">The "Pacific
Scheme"
discussed.</p>

<p>But the Governor showed himself more reasonable; a
calmer discussion ensued, and the promoters
were informed that the Company would be
ready to make a grant of land for the actual
site of a road and telegraph through their territory.
Nothing more would be vouchsafed, unless, as they
had informed the Duke of Newcastle, they were paid for all
their rights and property.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0507" id="im_0507"></a>
<img src="images/im_0507.jpg" width="404" height="294" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fort Prince of Wales.</span><br />
(<i>Drawn from an old print.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>"The offer," observes Sir Edward, "of a mere site of a road
and ground for telegraph poles was no use. So, just as we
were leaving, I said, 'We are quite ready to consider your
offer to sell; and to expedite matters, will you allow us
to see your accounts, charters, etc.' They promised to
consult their Court."</p>

<p>The result of this promise was that the promoters were
put into communication with "old Mr. Roberts, aged eighty-five,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
their accountant, and with their solicitor, Mr. Maynard."
Many interviews took place at Hudson's Bay House between
these parties. On the 17th of March, 1863, Mr. Watkin met
the Governor, Mr. Ellice, junior (son of Edward Ellice, who
had been nick-named the "Old Bear"), Mr. Matheson and
Mr. Maynard, at Hudson's Bay House. A number of account
books were produced.</p>

<p>"Next day I had a long private interview with Mr. Maynard,
but could not see the balance-sheet The same day,
I saw the Duke with Messrs. Glyn and Benson." On the
following day, the chief promoter spent the forenoon with
Mr. Roberts, the accountant, and his son and assistant, at
Hudson's Bay House.</p>

<p>"Mr. Roberts told him many odd things," he says; "one
was, that the Company had had a freehold farm on the site of
the present City of San Francisco of one thousand acres, and
had sold it just before the gold discoveries for £1,000, because
two factors quarrelled over it. I learnt a great deal of the
inside of the affair, and got some glimpses of the competing
North-West Company, amalgamated by Mr. Edward Ellice,
its chief mover, many years agone, with the Hudson's Bay
Company. Pointing to some boxes in his private room one
day, Mr. Maynard said, 'There are years of Chancery in
those boxes, if anyone else had them.' And he more than
once quoted a phrase of the Old Bear, 'My fortune came late
in life.'"</p>

<p class="sidenote">The
International
Financial
Association.</p>

<p>In spite of the Duke's indisposition, he expressed the
greatest interest in the progress of the negotiations. Yet the
prospect of Government aid was now remote. Two ways were
open to raise the money for a purchase of the Company's
rights&mdash;to secure the names and support of fifteen persons,
millionaires, for £100,000 each; the other to
hand the proposed purchase over to the newly-organized
International Finance Association,
who were eager to find some important enterprise
to put before the public. The first method
seemed to recommend itself to the promoters; and the friends
of the project could easily have underwritten the necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
amount. But the Company now announced that it would give
no credit. "We must take up the shares as presented and pay
for them over the counter." There was, therefore, no alternative.
Mr. Richard Potter, acting for the capitalists, completed
the negotiations. The shares were taken over and paid for
by the International Financial Association, who issued new
stock to the public to an amount which covered a large provision
of new capital for the extension of business by the
Company, and at great profit to themselves. As regards the
new Hudson's Bay shareholders, their two hundred and one
shares were subsequently reduced by returns of capital to one
hundred and thirty-one, and having attained a value of thirty-seven,
during the "land boom" period twenty years later
stood at two hundred and forty-one.</p>

<p>A Hudson's Bay Company prospectus was issued. It was
understood that the International Financial Association were
merely agents, that the shares would not remain in their
hands, but would pass to the proprietors, who would, of
course, only enjoy the rights such shares carried. They
would, in fact, be a continuation of the Company, only their
efforts would be directed to the promotion of the settlement
of the country; the development of the postal and transit
communications being one of the objects to which they were
pledged. A new council had been formed, and amongst its
members was Mr. Eden Colville, one of the old committee,
whom the Duke praised publicly in the highest terms, as a
"man of business and good sense."</p>

<p>There was one man in London who was astonished at what
had taken place. Edward Ellice still lived, but his commanding
figure was bent by the weight of years. As we have seen,
it was he who, in 1821, played the principal part in the
amalgamation of the rival companies. He had grown to be
proud of the Company, proud of its history, of its traditions,
of its service; and he seemed to detect in this transfer, its fall.
A few months before his death, in 1863, he met one of the
negotiators at Burlington House. He confronted him for some
moments without speaking, in a state of abstraction. Then
he passed on, like a man "endeavouring to recollect a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
history of difficulty, and to realize how strangely it had all

<p>Ellice had said, before the Parliamentary Committee of
1857, in reply to a question put by a member as to what
probability there was of a settlement being made, "within
what you consider to be the southern territories of the
Hudson's Bay Company?" "None; in the lifetime of the
youngest man now alive!"</p>

</p>

<p>All this had taken place in London. The sale had been
negotiated between financiers. Not a word of what was
impending had crossed the Atlantic to the hunting-grounds
of the North-West&mdash;to the body of men who were, as much
as the Governor, the Committee and the sleeping partners,
members of the Great Company. Yet their voice had never
been heard, nor their consent to the transaction obtained.
By the Deed Poll it was provided that the profits of the fur-trade
(less interest on capital employed) were to be divided
into one hundred parts, sixty parts going to the stockholders
and forty to the "wintering partners." What would the
"wintering partners" say to this brilliant "game of chess"
which had been played with the stockholders for interests
which were jointly theirs?</p>

<p class="sidenote">Indignation
of the
Wintering
Partners.</p>

<p>No sooner had the papers been signed, and the million
and a half sterling paid over, than misgivings seem to
have seized the minds of those directly interested.
Yet, on their behalf, it was urged that
the Company's posts and hunting grounds still
remained. That the factors and traders would
be as well off under the new <i>régime</i> as the old&mdash;that
the mere change of one body of shareholders for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
another could affect them nothing&mdash;that, in fact, they would
really benefit by having men of newer ideas and a more
progressive spirit.</p>

<p>The news, once in the newspapers, travelled fast, and in a
few weeks at the less distant posts, and in a few months at
the more remote ones, the rumour ran that the Company had
sold out&mdash;that the London partners had betrayed the real
workers in the wilderness.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0512" id="im_0512"></a>
<img src="images/im_0512.jpg" width="410" height="311" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fort Garry.</span></p>
</div>

<p>A large number of the Company's chief factors and traders
had, it appeared, addressed a memorial to the Company in
London, when first the rumour of a sale had reached them.
They declared that they had been informed that no transfer
was probable, but if it took place it would not be without
previous consultation. They now learned for the first time
from the newspapers that these arrangements had been made.
An influential member of the new Company predicted that a
general resignation of the officers from Labrador to Sitka
would ensue, followed by a confederation amongst themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
in order to carry on the fur-trade in competition with the
Company. They had, they said, "the skill, the will, and the
capital to do it."</p>

<p>It was said that the appearance of Mr. Lampson's name as
Deputy Governor of the new Company had heightened the
first feeling of distrust, for this gentleman and his commercial
connections had long been the Company's great rivals in the
fur marts, carrying on a vigorous competition at all accessible
points.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">Governor
Dallas's
Suggestions.</p>

<p>Governor Dallas, almost immediately upon his arrival in
Montreal, caused a circular to be issued, addressed to all the
factors, completely refuting all these charges and innuendoes.
Many conferences took place between Dallas and Watkin as
to the working of the Company in the fur territories on the
new basis. Dallas kept the Governor and Committee in
London fully advised of the state of affairs, accompanied
by proposals as to the compensation to be
allowed the aggrieved wintering partners. An
interesting object, which it was desired to
accomplish at this time, was an exchange of
boundary between the Company and the United States, so as
to permit Superior City being brought into British territory
by means of a fair payment and exchange of land. The
negotiations looking to this end, although at one time
promising, proved a failure.</p>

<p>It was believed that the first measure necessary towards the
re-organization of the Hudson's Bay service would be the
abolition or modification of the Deed Poll, under which the
trade was then conducted. The wintering partners (chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
factors and chief traders) had certain vested rights, and these
could not be interfered with without compensation.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>One mode suggested by Governor Dallas of removing the
difficulty was to ascertain the value of a retired interest, and
bestow a money compensation to each officer on his entering
into an agreement to consent to the abrogation of the Deed
Poll. As regarded the shares held in retirement, some of the
interests had nearly run out and none of the parties had
any voice in the business. The value of a (one-eighty-fifth)
share was ascertained to be (on the average of the previous
thirteen "outfits") about £408, at which rate a chief
factor's retired interest would amount to £3,264, and a chief
trader's to £1,632. Adding the customary year's furlough on
retiring, a factor's retired allowance would be £4,080, and a
trader's £2,040. On such a scale of commutation it would
cost the Company £114,500 to buy out its officers.</p>

<p>As a set-off to this outlay Governor Dallas suggested a
substantial reduction in salaries. Under the then existing
organization the pay of officers in the service was £2,000 to
the Governor-in-Chief, £16,000 amongst sixteen chief factors,
£14,000 to thirty-five chief traders, and £10,000 to the clerks,
a total officers' pay-roll of £38,000. He proposed to cut this
down as follows:</p>

<table summary="Salaries">
<tr>
<td>Governor-in-Chief</td>
<td class="tdr">£2,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lieutenant-Governor</td>
<td class="tdr">1,250</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Four Councillors at £800</td>
<td class="tdr">3,200</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Twenty-five chief traders at £300</td>
<td class="tdr">7,500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>One hundred clerks at various salaries</td>
<td class="tdru">10,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdr">£23,950</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>But Sir Edmund and his colleagues thought otherwise. The
wintering partners were not yet to reap any profit from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
sale of the Company's assets. The Deed Poll remained in
full force until 1871, when they were paid £107,055 out of the
money received from Canada for Rupert's Land and the
North-West.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Threatened
Deadlock
in Red River
Settlement.</p>

<p>In 1863 the Company's government had almost come to a
deadlock in the Red River settlement. Two cases had just
occurred of prisoners having been forcibly
rescued from gaol; and they, with about thirty
to fifty others implicated in the riots, continued
at large, fostering discontent. The only paper
published, the notorious <i>Nor'-Wester</i>, was in the
hands of the Company's bitterest enemies.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The position
of those in authority was so disagreeable that it was with
great difficulty that Governor Dallas persuaded the magistrates
to continue their duties. Governor McTavish, who was in
charge of Assiniboine, resigned, and others were prepared to
follow his example, including the Governor-in-Chief himself.
Fortunately the open malcontents were few in number and the
volunteer force was sufficient to protect the gaol and support
law and order, were it not for the unwise zeal of the
Company's partisans who were ready to engage in a free
fight with the agitators. This, beyond question, would have
led to a repetition of the Semple tragedy of 1816. It may be
noted that the Company's unpopularity in the Red River
country, according to Governor Dallas, "arose entirely from
the system, not from the faults of its administrators."</p>

<p>The agitation against the Company still continued, but
slowly. It seemed difficult for the parties interested in the
abolition of the Company's rights to agree upon a single
scheme which would be permanently satisfactory, and not too
costly. Sir Edmund Head expressed himself in favour of a
complete sale of rights and ownership to the Imperial
authorities. But this scheme was, as has been seen, beset
with almost insuperable difficulties. In November, 1863, Sir
Edmund suggested that an equal division be made of the
territory fit for settlement between the Company and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
Crown, with inclusion of specified tracts in the share of the
former; secondly, that the Company construct the road and
telegraph; thirdly, that the Crown purchase such of the
Company's premises as should be required for military use,
and to pay the Company a net third of all future revenue
from gold and silver.</p>

<p>In his Speech from the Throne, on the 19th February, 1864,
Lord Monk, the Governor-General of Canada, alluded to the
matter, which was beginning to engross the public mind.</p>

<p>"The condition," said he, "of the vast region lying on the
north-west of the settled portions of the Province is daily
becoming a question of great interest. I have considered
it advisable to open a correspondence with the Imperial
Government, with a view to arrive at a precise definition of
the geographical boundaries of Canada in that direction.
Such a definition of boundary is a desirable preliminary to
further proceedings with respect to the vast tracts of land in
that quarter belonging to Canada, but not yet brought under
the action of our political and municipal system."</p>

<p>It was hoped by many that the Company could be
induced to sell out its rights to the Imperial Government,
and out of the territory to carve out a new Crown Colony.</p>

<p>In the course of the ensuing debate on the address, the
Honourable William McDougall, Minister of Crown Lands,
who was officially concerned in the matter, stated that "the
Government of Canada had reached a conclusion upon the
advisability of determining whether the Red River territory
belonged to Canada or to some other country." The consequence
was that a correspondence had been opened with the
Imperial Government upon the subject. Mr. McDougall
thereupon announced his individual view of the case as being
that "Canada was entitled to claim as a portion of its soil all
that part of the North-West territory that could be proved to
have been in possession of the French at the time of the
cession of Canada to the British."</p>

<p>It was not at all likely that the Duke of Newcastle would
share such a view, or that he would entirely acquiesce with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
the suggestion of Sir Edmund Head on behalf of the Company.
Under date of the 11th of March, and 5th of April,
1864, he formulated the appended proposals:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
1. The Company to surrender to the Crown its territorial rights.</p>

<p>2. To receive one shilling for every acre sold by the Crown but
limited to £150,000 in all, and to fifty years in duration, whether or not
the receipts attained that amount.</p>

<p>3. To receive one-fourth of any gold revenue, but limited to £100,000
in all, and to fifty years in duration.</p>

<p>4. To have one square mile of adjacent land for every lineal mile
constructed of road and telegraph to British Columbia.
</p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">The surrender
of Territorial
Rights.</p>

<p>These proposals were carefully considered by Sir Edmund
Head and his colleagues, and it was decided at a meeting on
the 13th of April to accept them, subject to certain
alterations. It was urged that the amount
of payments within fifty years should either
not be limited or else placed at the sum of
£1,000,000 sterling, instead of a quarter of that sum. The
Company also suggested that a grant be made to it of five
thousand acres of wild land for every fifty thousand acres sold
by the Crown.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Duke of Newcastle had been succeeded
in the Colonial Secretaryship by Mr. Cardwell, who
on the 6th of June wrote to say that he could not entertain
the amendments of the Company. For several months
nothing was done, but in December the Honourable Adventurers
again met and again showed their desire for an
amicable and reasonable arrangement. They offered to
accept £1,000,000 for the territory which they then defined,
and which was substantially in extent the whole region
granted them in the Charter of Charles II. In 1865 the Hon.
George Brown went to England to come to terms over the
proposed transfer, but without success.</p>

<p class="sidenote">America purchases
Alaska.</p>

<p>The charter of the Russian Company was about to expire.
It had underlet to the Hudson's Bay Company all its franchise
on the mainland between 54° 40' and Mount St Elias;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
and now it was proposed that an American Company, holding
direct from the Russian Government, should be
substituted, and it seemed to the Americans a
good opportunity to organize a fur-trading company
to trade between the States and the Russian possessions
in America. But before the matter could mature, the
American and Russian Governments interposed with a
treaty, by which Alaska was ceded to the States for
$7,200,000 in gold. Few treaties have ever been carried
out in so simple a manner. Russia was glad to be rid of
her possessions in North America. The sum of $7,000,000
was originally agreed upon; but when it was understood that
a fur company and an ice company enjoyed monopolies under
the existing government, it was decided to extinguish these
for the additional sum.</p>

<p>On 1st July, 1867, the Confederation of the scattered British
Provinces of North America was made an accomplished fact,
amidst general rejoicings. On the 4th of December, Mr.
McDougall, who was now Minister of Public Works for the
new Dominion of Canada, brought in, at the first session
of Parliament, a series of resolutions directly relating to the
acquisition of Rupert's Land and the Great North-West:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
1. That it would promote the prosperity of the Canadian people and
conduce to the advantage of the whole Empire if the Dominion of
Canada, constituted under the provisions of the British North America
Act, 1867, were extended westward to the shores of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>2. That the colonization of the lands of the Saskatchewan, Assiniboine,
and Red River Settlements, the development of the mineral wealth
which abounds in the regions of the North-West, and the extension of
commercial intercourse through the British possessions in America from
the Atlantic to the Pacific, are alike dependent upon the establishment of
a stable government for maintenance of law and order in the North-West
Territories.</p>

<p>3. That the welfare of the sparse and widely-scattered population of
British subjects of European origin, already inhabiting these remote and
unorganized territories, would be materially enhanced by the formation
therein of political institutions bearing analogy, as far as circumstances
will admit, to those which exist in the several Provinces of this
Dominion.</p>

<p>4. That the 146th section of the British North America Act, 1867,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
provides for the admission of Rupert's Land and the North-West Territory,
or either of them, into union with Canada upon terms and conditions
to be expressed in Addresses from the Houses of Parliament of the
Dominion to Her Majesty, and which shall be approved of by the Queen
in Council.</p>

<p>5. That it is accordingly expedient to address Her Majesty, that
she would be graciously pleased, by and with the advice of Her Most
Honourable Privy Council, to unite Rupert's Land and the North-West
Territory with the Dominion of Canada, and to grant to the Parliament
of Canada authority to legislate for their future welfare and good
government.</p>

<p>6. That in the event of the Imperial Government agreeing to transfer
to Canada the jurisdiction and control over this region, it would be
expedient to provide that the legal rights of any corporation, company, or
individual within the same will be respected; and that in case of difference
of opinion as to the extent, nature, or value of these rights, the
same shall be submitted to judicial decision, to be determined by mutual
agreement between the Government of Canada and the parties interested.
Such agreement to have no effect or validity until first sanctioned by the
Parliament of Canada.</p>

<p>7. That upon the transference of the territories in question to the
Canadian Government, the claims of the Indian tribes to compensation
for lands required for purposes of settlement would be considered, and
settled in conformity with the equitable principles which have uniformly
governed the Crown in its dealings with the aborigines.
</p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">Deputation
goes to
England.</p>

<p>In the following year a delegation to arrange the terms for
the acquisition by Canada of Rupert's Land and the North-West
Territory arrived in England. It consisted of Sir
George Étienne Cartier and Mr. William McDougall. On
presenting themselves at the Colonial Office they
were invited by the Duke of Buckingham and
Chandos, then Secretary of State for the
Colonies, to visit him at Stowe "for the purpose
of discussing freely and fully the numerous and difficult
questions involved in the transfer of these great territories to
Canada." To the Duke's country-seat the delegates accordingly
went. Here, one of the first things the Duke communicated
to them was that the Company being lords-proprietors
were to be treated as such, and not as parties having a defective
title and fit subjects for that "spoliation" previously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
deplored by Cartier.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> There can be no manner of doubt that,
taking this view, the Company's demands were most reasonable.
But the Canadian delegates were not content to take
this view. There had been so much irresponsible hue-and-cry
about the weakness of the Company's title, that they doubtless
felt themselves privileged to hold out for better terms. While
negotiations were thus pending in London, the Duke of
Buckingham quitted office with his colleagues, and was
succeeded by Earl Granville. Almost at the same time the
Earl of Kimberley, the Company's Governor, resigned, and
was replaced by Sir Stafford Northcote. In January, 1869,
the new Colonial Secretary transmitted to the delegates the
reply of the Company, declining their counter-proposals, and
inviting them to communicate to him any observations they
might desire to offer further on the situation.</p>

<p>"We felt reluctant," to quote the language of the delegates,
"as representatives of Canada, to engage in a controversy
with the Company concerning matters of fact, as well as
questions of law and policy, while the negotiation with it
was being carried on by the Imperial Government in its own
name and of its own authority."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Canada exerts
pressure on
the Company.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, these scruples were soon overcome. They
accepted Lord Granville's invitation, and on the 8th February
stated at length their views upon the various points raised by
the Governor of the Company, which views clearly demonstrated
that the Dominion was by no means
prepared to deal with the Honourable Adventurers
in a spirit of generosity or even of equity.
Lord Granville now came forward with plans of
his own, but these were not agreeable to Sir George Cartier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
and Mr. McDougall. While the negotiations were in progress
the Company lodged an indignant complaint against the
Canadian Government for undertaking the construction of a
road between the Lake of the Woods and the Red River
settlement without first having procured its consent. Stormy
meetings of the Honourable Adventurers were held; it seemed
impossible to resist the pressure which was being brought
to bear. Had the old governor and committee been in
existence it is possible this pressure would have been longer
withstood. The delegates returned to Canada, but they had
succeeded in no slight measure in impressing upon the
Imperial Government their peculiar views. On the 9th of
March, Lord Granville employed the following language to
the Governor of the Company:</p>

<p>"At present the very foundations of the Company's title are
not undisputed. The boundaries of its territory are open to
questions of which it is impossible to ignore the importance.
Its legal rights, whatever these may be, are liable to be
invaded without law by a mass of Canadian and American
settlers, whose occupation of the country on any terms it will
be little able to resist; while it can hardly be alleged that the
terms of the charter, or its internal constitution, are such as
to qualify it under all these disadvantages for maintaining
order and performing the internal and external duties of
government."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Lack of Military
system
Company's
weakness.</p>

<p>There was the Company's weakness. No sovereign in
Europe had a clearer right to his or her dominions, perhaps
no rule was wiser or more beneficent, but the one powerful,
indispensable adjunct to sovereign authority
it lacked&mdash;a military system.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> With a standing
army the Company's rights would have been
secure&mdash;but it was a king without soldiers. It
required ten thousand drilled men to defend its frontiers&mdash;it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
was too late in the day to organize such a force, it could
only submit gracefully to its envious and powerful neighbours.
Cession was perhaps inevitable; the terms which
Lord Granville now proposed it decided to accept.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
1. The Hudson's Bay Company to surrender to Her Majesty all the
rights of government, property, etc., in Rupert's Land, which are specified
in 31 and 32 Victoria, clause 105, section 4; and also all similar rights in
any other part of British North America, not comprised in Rupert's
Land, Canada, or British Columbia.</p>

<p>2. Canada is to pay to the Company £300,000 when Rupert's Land is
transferred to the Dominion of Canada.</p>

<p>3. The Company may, within twelve months of the surrender, select a
block of land adjoining each of its stations, within the limits specified in
Article 1.</p>

<p>4. The size of the blocks is not to exceed &mdash;&mdash; acres in the Red River
country, nor 3,000 acres beyond that territory, and the aggregate extent
of the blocks is not to exceed 50,000 acres.</p>

<p>5. So far as the configuration of the country admits, the blocks are to
be in the shape of parallelograms, of which the length is not more than
double the breadth.</p>

<p>6. The Hudson's Bay Company may, for fifty years after the surrender,
claim in any township or district within the Fertile Belt, in which land is
set out for settlement, grants of land not exceeding one-twentieth of the
land so set out. The blocks so granted to be determined by lot, and the
Hudson's Bay Company to pay a ratable share of the survey expenses,
not exceeding &mdash;&mdash; an acre.</p>

<p>7. For the purpose of the present agreement, the Fertile Belt is to be
bounded as follows: On the south by the United States Boundary; on
the west by the Rocky Mountains; on the north by the northern branch
of the Saskatchewan; on the east by Lake Winnipeg, the Lake of the
Woods, and the waters connecting them.</p>

<p>8. All titles to land up to the 8th of March, 1869, conferred by the
Company, are to be confirmed.</p>

<p>9. The Company to be at liberty to carry on its trade without hindrance,
in its corporate capacity, and no exceptional tax is to be placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
on the Company's land, trade or servants, nor an import duty on goods
introduced by them previous to the surrender.</p>

<p>10. Canada is to take over the materials of the Electric Telegraph at
cost price, such price including transport, but not including interest for
money, and subject to a deduction for ascertained deteriorations.</p>

<p>11. The Company's claim to land under agreement of Messrs. Vankoughnet
and Hopkins to be withdrawn.</p>

<p>12. The details of this arrangement, including the filling up of the
blanks in Articles 4 and 6, to be settled at once by mutual agreement.
</p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">Cession to
Canadian
Government.</p>

<p>On such terms did the Canadian Government acquire this
vast territory of two million three hundred
thousand square miles. In that portion designated
the Fertile Belt, comprising three
hundred million acres, there were agricultural
lands believed to be capable of yielding support to twenty-five
million people.</p>

<p>Filled with high hopes as to the future of the country they
had thus acquired, the Canadian Government was confronted
by the necessity of providing it with a suitable form of government
to replace that of the Company. Little did the
public men who had interested themselves in the negotiations
ponder on the difficulties of the task. Apparently they undertook
it with a light heart. During the session of 1869 an
Act was passed at Ottawa providing a provisional form of
government in the territory, and in October of the same year
the Hon. William McDougall received the appointment of
Lieutenant-Governor. But before he set out on his duties
surveying parties had been busy in the Red River settlement,
laying out townships and instituting an extended series of
surveys.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Forlorn case of
the Métis.</p>

<p>In order to be in the place of his government when by
the Queen's Proclamation it should become a portion of
the Dominion of Canada, McDougall, in the month of
November, found himself at the frontier of his Province.
But the transfer was not to be consummated without bloodshed.
A portion of the little community of Red River raised
its voice in vehement protest against the arrangements made
between the Government of Canada and the Company.
These malcontents, chiefly French half-breeds, headed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
Louis Riel, expelled the Governor appointed by the Dominion
and planned a resistance to all authority emanating from the
same source. They assembled in large numbers, and, after
fortifying portions of the road between Pembina and Fort
Garry, had taken possession of the latter post. Upon consideration
of the case of these wild and ignorant Métis, it is
difficult to withhold from them sympathy. Settled government,
forms of law, state duty, exactions of citizenship, the
sacrifices and burdens of urban civilization&mdash;of these he knew
but dimly, and held them in a vague horror. He knew that
men lived and ground out their lives in cities afar off, and that
by means of their wealth they possessed power; that they had
cast envious eyes on the hunting-grounds of the Indian and
his half-brother the Métis; that they sought to wrest him
from his lands and mark it off into town lots, people his
beloved prairies and exterminate his race. They must mean
him ill or they would not work in such a silent, stealthy
fashion to dispossess him and drive him farther west into
unfamiliar fastnesses. There were fifteen thousand souls in
the country bordering on Red River, and the
majority objected, not without reason, that such
an arrangement as had just been carried out
should be done without their consent or having been consulted.
Was it wonderful that the half-breed, resenting this march of
civilization which would trample him and his possessions to
atoms, should arise, seize his rude weapons, and prepare for
war?</p>

<p>It is true the insurrection of 1869-70 could have been
averted. It would have been easy, through an agent of tact
and eloquence, to have dispelled the illusions which had taken
possession of the Métis, and to have restored confidence as to
the policy of Canada. But was it the Hudson's Bay Company's
duty to enlighten the aggrieved inhabitants? The Company
who had been bullied and badgered and threatened with
confiscation unless it agreed to a renunciation of its rights?
Was it the fault of the Company that several thousand wild
Métis children of the wilderness, passionately attached to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
old order of things, were in their hearts loyal to the Company,
which fed and clothed and administered law to them?<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>The insurgents, growing bolder, had taken possession of
Fort Garry, where a council of half-breeds was held and the
inhabitants called upon to send delegates to a national
convention. The English colonists accepted the invitation,
but were soon made aware that Riel and his supporters were
resolved on more desperate measures than they could themselves
countenance. The authority of the Company had been
observed; but it was now disregarded; the books and records
of the Council of Assiniboia were seized, and on the 1st
December a "Bill of Rights" was passed by the "Provisional
Government." This act of open rebellion caused the secession
of the English; insurgency was now rampant and many of
the inhabitants found themselves incarcerated in gaol. Then
followed the illegal infliction of capital punishment upon
Thomas Scott, a young Orangeman, and the despatch of
Colonel (now Lord) Wolseley to the seat of trouble. Leaving
Toronto on the 25th of May, 1870, Wolseley and his force,
after a long and arduous journey, arrived at Fort Garry on
the 24th of August. But the rebellion was already over, and
the chief instigator and his companions had fled.</p>

<p>For many years the Company's officers in charge of the
various districts in Rupert's Land had annually met in Council
for the regulation and discussion of affairs of the fur-trade in
general. Regarding themselves as true partners of the Company,
they naturally looked to share with the shareholders in
the sum agreed to be paid by Canada for its territory.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Turbulent
meetings at
Hudson's Bay
House.</p>

<p>In July, just one month before the entrance of the future
hero of Tel-el-Kebir and the British troops into Fort Garry,
a last meeting of the council of officers of the Honourable
Hudson's Bay Company was held at the post known as Norway
House. It was presided over by Fort Garry's Governor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
Mr. Donald Alexander Smith,<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> a servant since boyhood of the
Company. At this meeting it was decided to represent the
claims of the officers to the partners in England. To this
end Mr. Smith was unanimously appointed their representative,
he undertaking the task of presenting their claims. The
London shareholders were by no means immediately
acquiescent. But although Sir Stafford
Northcote presided over some turbulent meetings
in Fenchurch Street, the claims of the
"wintering partners" were ultimately recognized in the
only manner possible. Out of the £300,000 paid by the
Dominion, the sum of £107,000 was divided amongst the
officers for the relinquishment of their claims.</p>

<p>The Governor of the Company, in his report to the shareholders
in November, stated that "since the holding of the
General Court on the 28th June, the Committee have been
engaged in proceeding with the re-organization of the fur-trade,
and have entered into an agreement with the Chief
Factors and Chief Traders for revoking the Deed Poll of
1834, and settling claims arising under it upon the terms
sanctioned by the proprietors at the last General Court.
They have also prepared the draft of a new Deed Poll
adopted to the altered circumstances of the trade."</p>

<p>A new era had thus begun in the history of the Honourable
Company of Merchants-Adventurers trading into
Hudson's Bay.</p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />
<br />
1821-1871.</h2>

<p class="hanging">
The Company still King in the North-West&mdash;Its Forts Described&mdash;Fort
Garry&mdash;Fort Vancouver&mdash;Franklin&mdash;Walla Walla&mdash;Yukon&mdash;Kamloops&mdash;Samuel
Black&mdash;Mountain House&mdash;Fort Pitt&mdash;Policy of the
Great Company.
</p>

<p>The Company, in yielding the sovereignty of the Great
North-West to Canada, was still a king, though crown and
sceptre had been taken from it. Its commercial ascendancy
was no whit injured; it is still one of the greatest corporations
and the greatest fur company in the world. But new interests
have arisen; its pristine pride, splendour and dignity, would
now be out of place. The old lion has been shorn of its mane,
and his roar is now no longer heard in the Great North-West.
It no longer crouches in the path of progress determined to
sell dearly the smallest sacrifice of its ancient rights and
privileges; it is ready to co-operate with the settler and
explorer, and all its whilom enemies.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Canada's debt
to the
Company.</p>

<p>Yet, since 1871, its history has not been without many
stirring passages. Its long record of steady work, enterprise,
and endurance, has never been greater. Its commanding
influence with the Indians, and with a large
number of the colonists, has enabled it to assist
the authorities in many ways and often in forwarding
the public interests, suppressing disorder
and securing the good-will of the Red men who
inhabit Canada. The Great Dominion owes much to the
Great Company.</p>

<p>The posts of the Company reach from the stern coasts of
Labrador to the frontiers of Alaska, and throughout this
enormous region it yet controls the traffic with the aborigines.
To-day there are one hundred and twenty-six posts at
which this active trade is conducted, besides those numerous
wintering stations or outposts, which migrate according to
circumstances and mercantile conditions.

<p class="sidenote">Latter-day
forts of the
Company.</p>

<p>The forts of the Company in Rupert's Land and on the
Pacific, with few exceptions, all resembled each other. When
permanent, they were surrounded by palisades about one
hundred yards square. The pickets were of poles and logs
ten or fifteen inches in diameter, sunk into the ground and
rising fifteen or twenty feet above it. Split
slabs were sometimes used instead of round
poles; and at two diagonally opposite corners,
raised above the tops of the pickets, two wooden
bastions were placed so as to command a view of the country.
From two to six guns were mounted in each of these bastions&mdash;four
six or twelve-pounders, each with its aperture like
the port-hole of a ship. The ground floor beneath served
as a magazine. Within the pickets were erected houses,
according to necessity, store and dwelling being most
conspicuous.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0531" id="im_0531"></a>
<img src="images/im_0531.jpg" width="400" height="272" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fort Pelly.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The older forts have already been described. When Fort
Garry was constructed it became the Company's chief post
and headquarters. High stone walls, having round towers
pierced for cannon at the corners, enclosed a square wherein
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
were substantial wooden buildings, including the storehouses,
dwellings, the Governor's residence and the gaol. Some
distance below Fort Garry, on Red River, was Stone Fort,
which comprised about four acres, with numerous buildings.</p>

<p>The chief establishment of the Saskatchewan district was
Fort Edmonton. It was of sexagonal form, with pickets,
battlemented gateways and bastions. Here were the usual
buildings, including the carpenter's shop, blacksmith's forge
and windmill. At Fort Edmonton were made and repaired,
boats, carts, sleighs, harness and other articles and appliances
for the annual voyage to York Factory, and for traffic between
posts. There was also here a large and successful farm, where
wheat, barley and vegetables were raised in abundance.</p>

<p>How different was Fort Franklin, a rough, pine-log hut on
the shore of Great Bear Lake, containing a single apartment
eighteen by twenty feet! It was roofed with sticks and moss,
and the interstices between the logs were filled with mud.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Fort
Vancouver.</p>

<p>In 1825 was built Fort Vancouver, the metropolitan establishment
of the Company on the Pacific. It stood on the
north side of the Columbia River, six miles above the eastern
mouth of the Willamette. At first located at the highest
point of some sloping land, about a mile from the river, this
site was found disadvantageous to transport and communication,
and the fort was moved a few years later to within a
quarter of a mile of the Columbia. The plan presented
the familiar parallelogram, but much larger than usual, of
about seven hundred and fifty feet in length and five hundred
in breadth. The interior was divided into two courts, with
about forty buildings, all of wood, except the powder
magazine, which was of stone. In the centre, facing the main
entrance, stood the Governor's residence, with the dining-room,
smoking-room, and public sitting-room or bachelors' hall, the
latter serving also for a museum of Indian
relics and other curiosities. Single men, clerks
and others, made the bachelors' hall their place
of resort, but artisans and servants were not admitted. The
residence was the only two-storey house in the fort, and before
its door were mounted two old eighteen-pounders. Two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
swivel guns stood before the quarters of the chief factor. A
prominent position was occupied by the Roman Catholic
chapel, to which the majority of the fort's inmates resorted,
the dining-hall serving for the smaller number of Church
of England worshippers. The other buildings were dwellings
for officers and men, school and warehouses, retail stores
and artisan shops. The interior of the dwellings exhibited,
as a rule, an unpainted pine-board panel, with bunks for
bedsteads, and a few other simple pieces of furniture.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0533" id="im_0533"></a>
<img src="images/im_0533.jpg" width="405" height="278" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fort Simpson.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Another post on the Pacific, of different character and
greater strength, was Fort Walla Walla. It stood on the site
of Fort Nez Percé, which was established when the Indians
attacked Ogden's party of fur-traders here in 1818. The
assault was repelled; but it was found necessary as a safeguard
to rear this retreat. Fort Walla Walla was built of
adobe and had a military establishment.</p>

<p>A strong fort was Fort Rupert, on the north-east coast of
Vancouver Island. For a stockade, huge pine trees were sunk
into the ground and fastened together on the inside with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>
beams. Round the interior ran a gallery, and at two opposite
corners were flanking bastions mounting four nine-pounders.
Within were the usual shops and buildings, while smaller
stockades protected the garden and out-houses.</p>

<p>Fort Yukon was the most remote post of the Company.
It was beyond the line of Russian America, and consequently
invited comparison with the smaller and meaner Russian
establishments. Its commodious dwellings for officers and
men had smooth floors, open fire-places, glazed windows, and
plastered walls. Its gun room, fur press, ice and meat wells
were the delight and astonishment of visitors, white and red.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0534" id="im_0534"></a>
<img src="images/im_0534.jpg" width="390" height="191" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">York Factory.</span></p>
</div>

<p>After the treaty of 1846, by which the United States
obtained possession of Oregon territory, the headquarters of
the Company on the Pacific Coast were transferred from Fort
Vancouver to Fort Victoria. This post was enclosed one
hundred yards square by cedar pickets twenty feet high. At
the north-east and south-west corners were octagonal bastions
mounted with six six-pounders. It had been founded three
years earlier as a trading post and depot for whalers, and
possessed more than three hundred acres under cultivation,
besides a large dairy farm, from which the Russian colonies
in Alaska received supplies.</p>

<p>Old Fort Kamloops was first called Fort Thompson, having
been begun by David Thompson, astronomer of the North-West
Company, on his overland journey from Montreal to
Astoria, by way of Yellowhead Pass, in 1810. It was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span>
capital of the Thompson River district, and one of the oldest
in all the Oregon region. After Thompson, hither came
Alexander Ross, who, in 1812, conducted operations there on
behalf of Astor's Pacific Fur Company. After the coalition in
1821, the veteran fur-trader, John McLeod, was in charge of
the Thompson River district. Then came Ermatinger, who
presided at Kamloops in 1828, when Governor Simpson
visited the fort and harangued the neighbouring Indians,
beseeching them to be "honest, temperate and frugal; to
love their friends, the fur-traders, and above all to bring in
their heaps of peltries, and receive therefor the goods of the
Company."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Legend of
Kamloops.</p>

<p>The post was not without thrilling legends and abundance
of romance. It was here that the Company's officer in command,
Samuel Black, in 1840, challenged his brother Scot,
and guest, David Douglas, the wandering botanist, to fight a
duel, because the latter bluntly, one night, over
his rum and dried salmon, had stigmatized the
Honourable Adventurers as "not possessing a
soul above a beaver skin." Black repelled in fury such an
assertion; but Douglas refused to fight. He took his departure,
only to meet his death shortly afterwards by falling
into a pit at Hawaii, while homeward bound.</p>

<p>If this was the fate of the calumniator of the Company,
that of its defender was not less tragic; for soon after his
display of loyalty, while residing at Fort Kamloops, he was
assassinated by the nephew of a friendly neighbouring chief,
named Wanquille, "for having charmed his uncle's life away."
Black's successor, John Tod, built a new fort on the opposite
side of the river, which differed but little from the later
fortresses of the Company. There were seven houses, including
stores, dwellings and shops, enclosed in palisades fifteen
feet in height, with gates on two sides and bastions at two
opposite angles.</p>

<p>Early in 1848 a small post was erected by the Company on
the Fraser River, near a village of the Lachincos, adjacent to
the rapids ascended by Alexander Anderson the previous
year. The fort was called Yale, in honour of Chief Factor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
Yale, who was at that time in charge of Fort Langley. It
was the only post on that wild stream, the Fraser, between
Langley and Alexandria, a distance of some three hundred
miles. Two causes led to its erection: the Waiilatpu massacre
in 1847, and the conclusion of the Oregon Treaty of
1846, which placed the boundary line several degrees north
of the Lower Columbia.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0536" id="im_0536"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Father Lacombe.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">Mountain
House.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most remarkable of the Company's
posts was Mountain House. "Every precaution known to
the traders," writes a visitor of thirty years ago,
"has been put in force to prevent the possibility
of a surprise during 'a trade.' Bars and bolts,
and places to fire down at the Indians who are trading,
abound in every direction; so dreaded is the name borne by
the Blackfeet, that it is thus their trading-post has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
constructed." Eighty years ago, the Company had a post far
south of the Bow River, in the very heart of the Blackfeet
country; but, despite all precautions, it was frequently plundered
and finally burnt down by the Blackfeet, and no attempt
was since made to construct another fort in their country.</p>

<p>The hilly country around Fort Pitt was frequently the
scene of Indian ambush and attack, and on more than one
occasion the post itself has been captured by the Blackfeet.
The surroundings are a favourite camping-ground of the
Crees; and it was found difficult to persuade the Blackfeet
that the factors and traders there are not the active friends
and allies of their enemies. In fact, they regarded both
Fort Pitt and Fort Carlton as places belonging to another
company from that which ruled at Mountain House and
Edmonton. "If it was the same company," they were
wont to say, "how could they give our enemies, the Crees,
guns and powder; for do they not give us guns and
powder, too?"</p>

<p>The strength of the Company throughout the vast region
where their rule was paramount, was rather a moral strength
than a physical one. Its roots lay deep in the heart of the
savage, who in time came to regard the great corporation as
the embodiment of all that was good, and great, and true,
and powerful. He knew that under its sway justice was
secured to him; that if innocent he would be unharmed, that
if guilty he would inevitably pay the penalty of his transgression.
The prairie was wide, the forests were trackless, but in
all those thousands of miles there came to be no haven for
the horse-thief, the incendiary or the murderer, where he
would be free, in his beleaguered fastness, to elude or defy
Nemesis. The Company made it its business to find and
punish the real offender; they did not avenge themselves on
his friends or tribe. But punishment was certain&mdash;blood was
paid for in blood, and there was no trial. Often did an
intrepid factor, trader or clerk, enter a hostile camp, himself
destitute of followers, walk up to the trembling malefactor,
raise his gun or pistol, take aim, fire, and seeing his man fall,
stalk away again to the nearest fort.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span></p>

<p>"This certainty of punishment," it was said, "acted upon
the savage mind with all the power of a superstition. Felons
trembled before the white man's justice, as in the presence of
the Almighty."</p>

<p>That sense of injustice which rankled in the bosoms of the
other Indians of the Continent, causing them to continually
break out and give battle to their tormentors and oppressors&mdash;a
warfare which, in 1870, had cost the United States more
than five hundred million of dollars, could not exist. The
Red men, as Red men, could have no well-founded grievance
against the Company, which treated white and red with
equity.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Great
Company's
Policy.</p>

<p>"I have no hesitation in attributing the great success
attendant for so many years upon the Indian
policy of the Hudson's Bay Company," wrote
an American Commissioner, Lieutenant Scott,
in 1867, "to the following facts:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The savages are treated justly&mdash;receiving protection in
life and property from the laws which they are forced to obey.</p>

<p>"There is no Indian Bureau with attendant complications.</p>

<p>"There is no pretended recognition of the Indian's title in
fee-simple to the lands on which he roams for fish or game.</p>

<p>"Intoxicating liquors were not introduced amongst these
people so long as the Hudson's Bay Company preserved the
monopoly of trade.</p>

<p>"Prompt punishment follows the perpetration of crime, and
from time to time the presence of a gunboat serves to remind
the savages along the coast of the power of their masters.
Not more than two years ago the Fort Rupert Indians were
severely punished for refusing to deliver up certain animals
demanded by the civil magistrate. Their village was
bombarded and completely destroyed by Her Britannic
Majesty's gunboat <i>Clio</i>."</p>

<p>What was the direct consequence of such a policy? That
among distant and powerful tribes trading posts were built
and maintained, well stocked with goods tempting to savage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
cupidity, yet peacefully conducted by one or two white men.
There was not a regular soldier in all this territory (except
the marines on shipboard and at Esquimault) and yet white
men could hunt through the length and breadth of the land
in almost absolute security.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="im_0539" id="im_0539"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Gateway to Fort Garry.</span><br />
(<i>Drawn by Edmund Morris, from a Photo taken in 1877.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Search all Europe and Asia, and you will find no parallel
to the present sway of the Company, for it feeds and clothes,
amuses and instructs, as well as rules nine-tenths of its subjects,
from the Esquimaux tribes of Ungava to the Loucheaux
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
at Fort Simpson, thousands of miles away&mdash;all look to it as
to a father.</p>

<p>The communication with the outside world is slight, yet
the thread that binds is encrusted with hoar frost, reaching
far away to that little island in the North Sea which we call
Britain. If these strong men, immured for years in the icy
wildernesses are moved by the news which reaches them twice
in the year, through a thousand miles and more of snow, it
is British news. Kitchener's victory at Khartoum sent a
patriotic thrill through thousands of bosoms six months after
it became known to the Englishman who is content to live at
home.</p>

<p class="hanging">
<span class="smcap">Charles the Second</span>, by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland,
France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c.</p>

<p>To all to whom these presents shall come, greeting:</p>

<p>Whereas our dear entirely beloved Cousin, Prince Rupert, Count
Palatine of the Rhine, Duke of Bavaria and Cumberland, &amp;c.; Christopher
Duke of Albemarle, William Earl of Craven, Henry Lord Arlington,
Anthony Lord Ashley, Sir John Robinson, and Sir Robert Vyner, Knights
and Baronets; Sir Peter Colleton, Baronet; Sir Edward Hungerford,
Knight of the Bath; Sir Paul Neele, Knight; Sir John Griffith and Sir
Philip Carteret, Knights; James Hayes, John Kirk, Francis Millington,
William Prettyman, John Fenn, Esquires; and John Portman, Citizen
and Goldsmith of London; have, at their own great cost, and charges,
undertaken an expedition for Hudson's Bay in the north-west part of
America, for the discovery of a new passage into the South Sea, and for
the finding some trade for furs, minerals, and other considerable
commodities, and by such their undertaking have already made such
discoveries as to encourage them to proceed further in pursuance of their
said design, by means whereof there may probably arise very great
advantages to us and our kingdom.</p>

<p>And whereas the said undertakers, for their further encouragement in
the said design, have humbly besought us to incorporate them, and grant
unto them and their successors the sole trade and commerce of all those
seas, straits, bays, rivers, lakes, creeks and sounds, in whatsoever latitude
they shall be, that lie within the entrance of the straits commonly
called the Hudson's Straits, together with all the lands, countries and
territories upon the coasts and confines of the seas, straits, bays, lakes,
rivers, creeks and sounds aforesaid, which are not now actually possessed
by any of our subjects, or by the subjects of any other Christian Prince
or State.</p>

<p>Now know ye, that we, being desirous to promote all endeavours tending
to the public good of our people, and to encourage the said undertaking,
have, of our especial grace, certain knowledge and mere motion, given,
granted, ratified and confirmed, and by these presents, for us, our heirs
and successors, do give, grant, ratify and confirm, unto our said Cousin,
Prince Rupert, Christopher Duke of Albemarle, William Earl of Craven,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span>
Henry Lord Arlington, Anthony Lord Ashley, Sir John Robinson, Sir
Robert Vyner, Sir Peter Colleton, Sir Edward Hungerford, Sir Paul
Neele, Sir John Griffith and Sir Philip Carteret, James Hayes, John
Kirk, Francis Millington, William Prettyman, John Fenn and John
Portman, that they, and such others as shall be admitted into the said
society as is hereafter expressed, shall be one body corporate and politic,
in deed and in name, by the name of "The Governor and Company of
Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay," and them by the
name of "The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England
trading into Hudson's Bay," one body corporate and politic, in deed
and in name, really and fully forever, for us, our heirs and successors,
we do make, ordain, constitute, establish, confirm and declare by these
presents, and that by the same name of Governor and Company of
Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay, they shall have
perpetual succession, and that they and their successors, by the name of
The Governor and Company of Adventures trading into Hudson's Bay,
be, and at all times hereafter shall be personable and capable in law to
have, purchase, receive, possess, enjoy and retain lands, rents, privileges,
liberties, jurisdictions, franchises and hereditaments, of what kind, nature
or quality so ever they be, to them and their successors; and also to
give, grant, demise, alien, assign and dispose lands, tenements, and
hereditaments, and to do and execute all and singular other things by
the same name that to them shall or may appertain to do; and that they
and their successors, by the name of The Governor and Company of
Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay, may plead and be
impleaded, answer and be answered, defend and be defended, in whatsoever
courts and places, before whatsoever judges and justices and other
persons and officers, in all and singular actions, pleas, suits, quarrels,
causes and demands whatsoever, of whatsoever kind, nature or sort, in
such manner and form as any other our liege people of this our realm
of England, being persons able and capable in law, may or can have,
purchase, receive, possess, enjoy, retain, give, grant, demise, alien, assign,
dispose, plead, defend and be defended, do, permit and execute: and
that the said Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading
into Hudson's Bay, and their successors, may have a common seal to
serve for all the causes and businesses of them and their successors, and
that it shall and may be lawful to the said Governor and Company, and
their successors, the same seal, from time to time, at their will and
pleasure, to break, change, and to make anew or alter, as to them shall
seem expedient.</p>

<p>And further we will, and by these presents, for us, our heirs and successors,
we do ordain that there shall be from henceforth one of the same
company to be elected and appointed in such form as hereafter in these
presents is expressed, which shall be called the Governor of the said
Company; and that the said Governor and Company shall or may select
seven of their number, and in such form as hereafter in these presents is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span>
expressed, which shall be called the Committee of the said Company,
which Committee of seven, or any three of them, together with the
Governor or Deputy Governor of the said Company for the time being
shall have the direction of the voyages of and for the said Company,
and the provision of the shipping and merchandises thereunto belonging,
and also the sale of all merchandises, goods and other things returned,
in all or any the voyages or ships of or for the said Company, and the
managing and handling of all other business, affairs and things belonging
to the said Company: And we will, ordain and grant by these
presents, for us, our heirs and successors, unto the said Governor and
Company, and their successors, that they, the said Governor and
Company, and their successors, shall from henceforth for ever be ruled,
ordered and governed according to such manner and form as is hereafter
in these presents expressed, and not otherwise; and that they shall
have, hold, retain and enjoy the grants, liberties, privileges, jurisdictions
and immunities only hereafter in these presents granted and expressed,
and no other: And for the better execution of our will and grant in
this behalf we have assigned, nominated, constituted and made, and
by these presents, for us, our heirs and successors, we do assign,
constitute and make our said Cousin Prince Rupert, to be the first and
present Governor of the said Company, and to continue in the said
office from the date of these presents until the 10th November then next
following, if he, the said Prince Rupert, shall so long live, and so until a
new Governor be chosen by the said Company in form hereafter expressed:
And also we have assigned, nominated and appointed, and
by these presents, for us, our heirs and successors, we do assign,
nominate and constitute the said Sir John Robinson, Sir John Vyner,

new Committees shall be chosen in form hereafter expressed: And
further we will and grant by these presents, for us, our heirs and successors,
unto the said Governor and Company, and their successors,
that it shall and may be lawful to and for the said Governor and Company
for the time being, or the greater part of them present at any public

<p class="center p6">THE ALASKA BOUNDARY LINE.</p>

<p>It has been said that but for the Hudson's Bay Company British
Columbia would not have been preserved to the British Crown. On
the Imperial frontier to the far north and west the Company early
established its posts, and vigorously sought to maintain them against,
first, Russian, and afterwards American, aggression.</p>

<p>The American purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867 included a strip
of the coast (<i>lisière de côté</i>) extending from north latitude 54° 40' to the
region of Mt. St. Elias. It was generally understood that this strip was
separated from the British possessions by a mountain range (then believed
to exist) parallel to the coast, as in event of this range being too remote,
by a line parallel to the windings (sinuosities) of the coast, nowhere
greater than ten marine leagues from the same.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a></span></p>

<p>There is nothing to lead one to suppose that the strip of coast was
designed to be continuous from the parallel of 54° 40' north latitude.
The recent great development of the North-West has shown the singular
value of this strip, which the American authorities, ignoring the exact
possessions of the Anglo-Russian treaty of 1825, has assumed to be their
territory. Recent American writers have been quick to perceive the
weakness of their case, and one of these, writing in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>,
uses this language:</p>

<p>"Arbitration is compromise.... Once before a board of arbitration,
the English Government has only to set up and vigorously urge all
its claims, and more that can easily be invented, and <i>it is all but
absolutely certain</i> that although <i>by tradition and equity</i> we should decline
<i>to yield a foot of what we purchased</i> in good faith from Russia, and which
has become doubly valuable to us by settlement and exploration, our
lisière will be promptly broken into fragments, and with much show of
impartiality divided between the two contracting parties." The italics are
mine. Tradition and (the American idea of) equity are hardly equal to
the language of a treaty negotiated so recently as 1825.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a><a name="Alaska" id="Alaska"></a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Convention with Russia.</span></p>

<p>His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland, and his Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, being desirous
of drawing still closer the ties of good understanding and friendship
which unite them, by means of an agreement which may settle, upon
the basis of reciprocal convenience, different points connected with the
commerce, navigation, and fisheries of their subjects on the Pacific
Ocean, as well as the limits of their respective possessions on the north-west
coast of America, have named plenipotentiaries to conclude a
convention for this purpose, that is to say&mdash;His Majesty the King of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Right Hon. Stratford
Canning, a member of his said Majesty's Most Hon. Privy Council, etc.;
and his Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, the Sieur Charles Robert
Count de Nesselrode, his Imperial Majesty's Privy Councillor, a member
of the Council of the Empire, Secretary of State for the Department of
Foreign Affairs, etc., and the Sieur Pierre de Poletica, his Imperial
Majesty's Councillor of State, etc.; who, after having communicated to
each other their respective full powers, found in good and due form, have
agreed upon and signed the following articles:&mdash;</p>

<p>Art. I.&mdash;It is agreed that the respective subjects of the high contracting
parties shall not be troubled or molested, in any part of the ocean
commonly called the Pacific Ocean, either in navigating the same, in
fishing therein, or in landing at such parts of the coast as shall not have
been already occupied, in order to trade with the natives, under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529"></a></span>
restrictions and conditions specified in the following articles.</p>

<p>II.&mdash;In order to prevent the right of navigating and fishing, exercised
upon the ocean by the subjects of the high contracting parties, from
becoming the pretext for an illicit commerce, it is agreed that the subjects
of his Britannic Majesty shall not land at any place where there may be a
Russian establishment, without the permission of the governor or commandant;
and, on the other hand, that Russian subjects shall not land,
without permission, at any British establishment on the north-west coast.</p>

<p>III.&mdash;The line of demarcation between the possessions of the high
contracting parties, upon the coast of the continent, and the islands of
America to the north-west, shall be drawn in the manner following:&mdash;Commencing
from the southernmost point of the island called Prince of
Wales's Island, which point lies in the parallel of 54 degrees, 40 minutes,
north latitude, and between the 131st and 133rd degree of west longitude
(meridian of Greenwich), the said line shall ascend to the north along the
channel called Portland Channel, as far as the point of the continent
where it strikes the 56th degree of north latitude; from this last-mentioned
point the line of demarcation shall follow the summits of the mountains
situated parallel to the coast, as far as the point of intersection of the 141st
degree of west longitude (of the same meridian); and, finally, from the
said point of intersection, the said meridian line of the 141st degree in its
prolongation as far as the Frozen Ocean, shall form the limit between
the Russian and British possessions on the Continent of America to the
north-west.</p>

<p>IV.&mdash;With reference to the line of demarcation laid down in the
preceding article, it is understood:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st: That the island called Prince of Wales's Island shall belong wholly
to Russia.</p>

<p>2nd: That wherever the summit of the mountains which extend in a
direction parallel to the coast, from the 56th degree of north latitude to
the point of intersection of the 141st degree of west longitude, shall prove
to be at the distance of more than ten marine leagues from the ocean,
the limit between the British possessions and the line of coast which is
to belong to Russia, as above-mentioned, shall be formed by a line
parallel to the windings of the coast, and which shall never exceed the
distance of ten marine leagues therefrom.</p>

<p>V.&mdash;It is moreover agreed, that no establishment shall be formed by
either of the two parties within the limits assigned by the two preceding
articles to the possessions of the other; consequently, British subjects
shall not form any establishment either upon the coast, or upon the
border of the continent comprised within the limits of the Russian
possessions as designated in the two preceding articles; and, in like
manner, no establishment shall be formed by Russian subjects beyond
the said limits.</p>

<p>VI.&mdash;It is understood that the subjects of his Britannic Majesty, from
whatever quarter they may arrive, whether from the ocean or from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span>
interior of the continent, shall forever enjoy the right of navigating
freely, and without any hindrance whatever, all the rivers and streams
which in their course towards the Pacific Ocean may cross the line of
demarcation upon the line of coast described in Article III of the present
convention.</p>

<p>VII.&mdash;It is also understood, that for the space of ten years from the
signature of the present convention, the vessels of the two powers, or
those belonging to their respective subjects, shall mutually be at liberty to
frequent without any hindrance whatever, all the inland seas, the gulfs,
havens, and creeks on the coast mentioned in Article III for the purpose
of fishing and of trading with the natives.</p>

<p>VIII.&mdash;The Port of Sitka, or Novo Archangelsk, shall be open to the
commerce and vessels of British subjects for the space of ten years from
the date of the exchange of the ratification of the present convention.
In the event of an extension of this term of ten years being granted to
any other power, the like extension shall be granted also to Great Britain.</p>

<p>IX.&mdash;The above-mentioned liberty of commerce shall not apply to the
trade of spirituous liquors, in fire-arms or other arms, gunpowder or other
warlike stores; the high contracting parties reciprocally engaging not to
permit the above-mentioned articles to be sold or delivered in any
manner whatever, to the natives of the country.</p>

<p>X.&mdash;Every British or Russian vessel navigating the Pacific Ocean, which
may be compelled by storms or by accident to take shelter in the ports of
the respective parties, shall be at liberty to refit therein, to provide itself
with all necessary stores, and to put to sea again, without paying any
other than port and lighthouse dues, which shall be the same as those
paid by national vessels. In case, however, the master of such vessel
should be under the necessity of disposing of a part of his merchandise
in order to defray his expenses, he shall conform himself to the regulations
and tariffs of the place where he may have landed.</p>

<p>XI.&mdash;In every case of complaint on account of an infraction of the
articles of the present convention, the civil and military authorities of the
high contracting parties, without previously acting or taking any forcible
measure, shall make an exact and circumstantial report of the matter to
their respective courts, who engage to settle the same in a friendly
manner, and according to the principles of justice.</p>

<p>XII.&mdash;The present convention shall be ratified, and the ratifications
shall be exchanged at London, within the space of six weeks, or sooner
if possible.</p>

<p>In witness whereof the respective plenipotentiaries have signed the
same and have affixed thereto the seals of their arms.</p>

<p>Done at St. Petersburg, the 16th (28th) day of February, in the year
of our Lord, 1825.</p>

and visited different parts of this Continent at nearly the same time. The
object was too immense for any of them to grasp the whole; and the claimants
were too powerful to submit to the exclusive or unreasonable pretensions of any
single potentate. To avoid bloody conflicts, which might terminate disastrously
to all, it was necessary for the nations of Europe to establish some principle
which all would acknowledge and which would decide their respective rights as
between themselves. This principle, suggested by the actual state of things,
was, 'that discovery gave title to the Government by whose subjects or by
whose authority it was made, against all other European governments, which
title might be consummated by possession.'"</p>

important settlement; before 1630, the Beaver and several other companies had
been organized, at Quebec, for carrying on the fur-trade in the West, near and
around the Great Lakes and in the North-West Territory; that the enterprise and
trading operations of these French Companies, and of the French colonists
generally, extended over vast regions of the northern and the north-western
portions of the continent; that they entered into treaties with the Indian tribes
and nations, and carried on a lucrative and extensive fur-trade with the natives.
In the prosecution of their trade and other enterprises these adventurers evinced
great energy, courage and perseverance. They had, according to subsequent
French writers, extended their hunting and trading operations to the Athabasca
country. It was alleged that some portions of the Athabasca country had before
1640 been visited and traded in, and to some extent occupied by the French
traders in Canada and their Beaver Company. From 1640 to 1670 these
discoveries and trading settlements had considerably increased in number and
importance.</p>

nations (who live like savages, many hundred leagues up the country), down to

attempted by such settlements, and to reside in that inhospitable country, before
the aforesaid English adventurers undertook the same."&mdash;<i>Company's Memorial</i>,

Chouard, writes Chouart. But as Dr. Brymner justly observes "he is as
little known by that name as Voltaire by his real name of Arouet, he being always
spoken of by the name of des Groseilliers, changed in one affidavit into 'Gooseberry.'"

Raids upon the territory and trading-posts controlled by the Dutch were a

Virginia, after their periodical strifes with the Indians, were devoted to forcing
the unhappy Hollanders to acknowledge the sovereignty of King Charles of
England.</p>

basins into which Canada is divided, that of Hudson's Bay is immeasurably the
largest, the extent of country draining into it being estimated at three million
square miles. To swell the mighty volume of its waters there come rivers which
take their rise in the Rocky Mountains on the west, and the Labrador wilderness
on the east; while southward its river roots stretch far down below the forty-ninth
parallel, reaching even to the same lake source whence flows a stream into the
Gulf of Mexico. A passing breath of wind may determine whether the ultimate
destiny of the rain drop falling into the little lake be the bosom of the Mexican
Gulf or the chilly grasp of the Arctic ice-floe.</p>

<p class="footnote">In Shea's <i>Charlevoix</i>, Vol. III, pp. 39, 40, it is stated that Père Dablon
attempted to penetrate to the northern ocean by ascending the Saguenay. Early
in June, two months after they set out, they found themselves at the head of the
Nekauba river, 300 miles from Lake St. John. Warned of the approach of the
Iroquois, they dared not proceed farther. In the New York Historical Documents
(p. 97) there is an account of Dablon from the time of his arrival in
Canada in 1655. He was immediately sent missionary to Onondaga, where he
continued with a brief interval until 1658. In 1661 he set out overland for
Hudson's Bay, but succeeded only in reaching the head waters of the Nekauba,
300 miles from Lac St. Jean.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> The beaver, amphibious and intelligent, had for centuries a considerable
place in commerce: and also a celebrity of its own as the familiar synonym for the
common covering of a man's head, and here the animal becomes historic. By
royal proclamation in 1638, Charles I., of England, prohibited the use of any
material in the manufacture of hats "except beaver stuff or beaver wool."
This proclamation was the death-warrant of beavers innumerable, sacrificed to the
demands of the trade.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_18" id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> The material for the two last chapters has been derived chiefly from a
pamphlet entitled "French Villainy in Hudson's Bay"; Radisson's own narrative,
and the "Journal" of Gillam, the elder, supplied to Dongan. Radisson's
narrative, divided into two parts, is written in a clear, legible character, and
evinces that its author was a person of some education. The first part is in
English, and was long the property of Samuel Pepys. Some years after Pepys'
death, the manuscript was purchased for a trifle by Rawlinson, the bibliophile.
The second part, recounting the voyages to Hudson's Bay in 1682-84, is half in
French and half in English; it is now in the Bodleian library.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> As an example of the absurd legends current some years later, and perpetuated,
I am sorry to say, to a later day, it would be hard to match this, from La
Potherie:</p>

<p class="footnote">"He (Preston) promised to Godey, one of his domestics, to create him perpetual
secretary of the Embassy, providing he engaged Radisson in his party.
Godey, the better to succeed, promised Radisson his daughter in marriage, whom
he (Radisson) espoused." (La Potherie, Vol. I, p. 145.) Godey was <i>aide-de-camp</i>
to Preston; he may have had a daughter, but Radisson certainly did not
espouse her, inasmuch as he was already married to Sir John Kirke's daughter,
who was still living.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> This is M. de la Barre's quaint fashion of spelling Dongan.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_21" id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Our Frenchmen have seen quite recently from Port Nelson some Indians
who were known to have traded several years ago at Montreal. The posts at
the head of the Bay Abbitibi and Nemisco can be reached through the woods and
seas; our Frenchmen are acquainted with the road. But in regard to the posts
occupied by the English in the River Bourbon or Port Nelson it is impossible to
hold any posts below them and convey merchandise thither except by sea. Some
pretend that it is feasible to go thence overland; but the river to reach that
quarter remains yet to be discovered, and when discovered could only admit the
conveyance of a few men and not of any merchandise. In regard to Hudson's
Bay, should the King not think proper for enforcing the reasons his Majesty has
for opposing the usurpation of the English on his lands, by the just titles proving
his Majesty's possession long before the English had any knowledge of the
country, nothing is to be done but to find means to support the Company of the
said Bay, formed in Canada, by the privilege his Majesty has been pleased this
year to grant to all his subjects of New France; and to furnish them for some
years with a few vessels of 120 tons, well armed and equipped. I hope with this
aid our Canadians will support this business, which will otherwise perish of itself;
whilst the English merchants, more powerful than our Canadians, will with good
ships continue their trade, whereby they will enrich themselves at the expense of
the Colony and the King's revenue.&mdash;Despatch of Denonville, 12th November,
1685.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_22" id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> Iberville declares that he split his head into fragments.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_23" id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> It has been truly observed that the protracted and bloody contest between the
French and English for the possession of the Bay was the result of a desire of the
Governor to have access to those waters, and the resolve of the latter to defeat this
purpose. "The truth is," says Mr. Lindsay, "the fur trade was only profitable
when carried on by water." At Quebec or Three Rivers forty beaver skins made
a canoe load. A single canoe load of northern furs was worth six of the southern.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> Although by this action the French Court directly participated in and lent its
support to the hostilities against the English, yet to all intents and purposes the
war was between two commercial corporations.</p>

<p class="footnote">The ruling spirits of the Northern Company were not unaware of the importance
and power of the enemy they had to deal with. In a pamphlet published in
France in 1692 there is amusing testimony to the consideration in which the
London Company was held by the French.</p>

<p class="footnote">"It is composed," says this authority, "of opulent merchants and noblemen of
the first quality; and it is known that the King himself is part proprietor, having
succeeded to that emolument with the other belongings to King James II. So
great are its profits that each member is worth at least £5,000 English sterling
above what he was before he embarked in the fur traffic. There can be no
secrecy about its intention, which is to subvert and subjugate the whole northern
Country to its sway."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_26" id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> The expedition which thus wrested away from the French all the forts at the
bottom of the Bay was in charge of Captain Grimington, an experienced naval
officer, who had seen service in the late wars.</p>

<p class="footnote">I have not been able to ascertain Grimington's fate, but in the Company's
minute-book, under date of 19th of May, 1714, I find the following entry:&mdash;</p>

<p class="footnote">"Mrs. Ann Grimington, widow of Captain Michael Grimington, deceased,
having delivered in her petition to the Company, the same was read, and considering
her poverty and the faithful services her husband performed for the
Company, the Committee agreed to allow the said Mrs. Grimington twelve
shillings per month for her subsistence, which the secretary is ordered to pay her
every first Monday in the month, to commence the first Monday in June next.
Interim, the secretary is ordered to pay her twenty shillings as charity, which is
afterwards to be taken out of the poor-box." This is sufficiently strong evidence
of the state into which the Company had fallen.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> To illustrate the divergence of authorities in such matters, I may mention that
while Jérémie, who took part in this expedition, calls the two ships the <i>Poli</i> and
<i>Charente</i>, in which he is followed by Abbé Ferland. Father Marest, the aumonier
of the crew, refers to the second ship as the <i>Salamandre</i>. His relation is entitled
"Le Voyage du <i>Poli</i> et <i>Salamandre</i>." In the letter of Frontenac to the French
minister (November 5, 1694) it is stated that Serigny commanded the <i>Salamandre</i>.
<i>La Potherie</i> observes that the ships sent out in 1694 were the <i>Poli</i> and <i>Salamandre</i>.
Furthermore, he declares, they sailed the 8th of August; Frontenac states the 9th,
and Jérémie the 10th (<i>Jour de St. Laurent</i>). <i>La Potherie</i> and Jérémie agree on
the date of their arrival, September 24th, although Ferland says it was the
20th.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> Jérémie gives us a detailed description of the fort in his "Relation." He
says it was composed of four bastions, which formed a square of thirty feet, with
a large stone house above and below. In one of these bastions was the storeroom
for furs and merchandise, another served for provisions; a third was used by
the garrison. All were built of wood. In a line with the first palisade there
were two other bastions, in one of which lodged the officers, the other serving as a
kitchen and forge. Between these two bastions was a crescent-shaped earthworks
sheltering eight cannon, firing eight-pound balls, and defending the side of the
fort towards the river. At the foot of this earthworks was a platform, fortified
by six pieces of large cannon. There was no butt-range looking out upon the
wood, which was a weak point; all the cannon and swivel-guns were on the
bastions. In all, the armament consisted of thirty-two cannon and fourteen
swivel-guns outside the fort and fifty-three inside; on the whole, calculated to
make a stalwart defence.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_29" id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Kelsey was the earliest English explorer in the North-West. Mention of his

the expedition in the character of chaplain. He is alluded to by the
French chronicler of the affair as "Fiche-Maurice de Kieri de la Maison du
Milord Kieri en Irlande."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_33" id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> Thus was concluded what was, in the opinion of the best authorities, French
and English, one of the fiercest and bloodiest battles of the war.</p>

dans le baie d'Hudson tombé en notre pouvoir, et la France resta seule maitresse
de cette region." (Tome II., p. 137.)</p>

<p class="footnote">But Garneau overlooked the three forts in James' Bay retaken by the
English in 1693; one of which, Fort Anne or Chechouan, he mistook for Fort
Nelson. At any rate Fort Albany or Chechouan remained in possession of the
Company from 1693; and they never lost it.</p>

<p class="footnote">It was unsuccessfully attacked by Menthel in 1709.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_36" id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> So strongly has the Treaty of Ryswick been interpreted in favour of France,
that some historians merely state the fact that by it she retained all Hudson's
Bay, and the places of which she was in possession at the beginning of the war.
The commissioners having never met to try the question of right, things remained
<i>in statu quo</i>. Now, whatever the commissioners might have done, had they ever
passed judgment on the cause the Treaty provided they should try, they could not
have given Fort Albany to the British, for it was one of the places taken by the
French during the preceding peace, and retaken by the British during the war,
and, therefore, adjudged in direct terms of the Treaty itself to belong to France.
Thus, then, it will be seen, declared the opponents of the Company, that the only
possession held by the Hudson's Bay Company during the sixteen years that intervened
between the Treaty of Ryswick and the Treaty of Utrecht was one to which
they had no right, and which the obligations of the Treaty required should be
given up to France.&mdash;<i>Report of Ontario Boundary Commission.</i></p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_37" id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> "Six or seven times over," the Company say in their reply.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_38" id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> After the battle of Port Nelson, Iberville had returned to France leaving
Martigny in command of the Fort. His subsequent career may be read elsewhere;
the Bay was no longer to be the theatre of his exploits. He perished in
1707 at Havana.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_39" id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> At Albany they were surrounded by the French on every side, a circumstance
which greatly sapped their commerce. Yet, even at this period, the
importation of beaver and other peltries from the single fort remaining to them
was above thirty thousand annually.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_40" id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> By the Treaty of Ryswick, Great Britain and France were respectively to
deliver up to each other generally whatever possessions either held before the
outbreak of the war, and it was specially provided that this should be applicable
to the places in Hudson's Bay taken by the French during the peace which
preceded the war, which, though retaken by the British during the war, were to
be given up to the French. Commissioners were to be appointed in pursuance of
the Treaty to determine the rights and pretensions which either nation had to the
places in Hudson's Bay. But these commissioners never met. The commissioners
must, however, have been bound by the text of the Treaty wherever it was
explicit. They <i>might</i>, said the Company's opponents, have decided that France
had a right to the whole, but they could <i>not</i> have decided that Great Britain had
a right to the whole. They would have been compelled to make over to France
all the places she took during the peace which preceded the war, for in that the
Treaty left them no discretion. The following are the words of the Treaty:&mdash;"But
the possession of those places which were taken by the French, during the
peace that preceded this present war, and were retaken by the English during the
war, shall be left to the French by virtue of the foregoing article." Thus the
Treaty of Ryswick recognized and confirmed the right of France to certain places
in Hudson's Bay distinctly and definitely, but it recognized no right at all on the
part of Great Britain; it merely provided a tribunal to try whether she had any
or not.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_41" id="Footnote_41" href="#FNanchor_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> "Therefore, we shall proceed to inform your Lordships of the present
melancholy prospects of our trade and settlement in Hudson's Bay, and that none
of his Majesty's plantations are left in such a deplorable state as those of this
Company, for by their great losses by the French, both in times of peace as well
as during the late war, together with the hardships they lie under by the late
Treaty of Ryswick, they may be said to be the only mourners by the peace. They
cannot but inform your Lordships that the only settlement that the Company now
have left in Hudson's Bay (of seven they formerly possessed) is Albany Fort,
vulgarly called Checheawan, in the bottom of the said Bay, where they are
surrounded by the French on every side, viz., by their settlements on the lakes
and rivers from Canada to the northwards, towards Hudson's Bay, as also from
Port Nelson (Old York Fort) to the southward; but beside this, the Company
have, by the return of their ship this year, received certain intelligence that the
French have made another settlement at a place called New Severn, 'twixt Port
Nelson and Albany Fort, whereby they have hindered the Indians from coming to
trade at the Company's factory, at the bottom of the Bay, so that the Company
this year have not received above one-fifth part of the returns they usually had
from thence, insomuch that the same doth not answer the expense of their
expedition."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_42" id="Footnote_42" href="#FNanchor_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> The Company being by these and other misfortunes reduced to such a low
and miserable condition, that, without his Majesty's favour and assistance, they
are in no ways able to keep that little remainder they are yet possessed of in
Hudson's Bay, but may justly fear in a short time to be deprived of all their trade
in those parts which is solely negotiated by the manufacturers of this kingdom.
Upon the whole matter, the Company humbly conceive, they can be no ways safe
from the insults and encroachments of the French, so long as they are suffered to
remain possessed of any place in Hudson's Bay, and that in order to dislodge
them from thence (which the Company are no ways able to do) a force of three
men-of-war, one bomb-vessel, and two hundred and fifty soldiers besides the
ships' company will be necessary, whereby that vast tract of land which is of so
great concern, not only to this Company in particular, but likewise to the whole
nation in general, may not be utterly lost to this kingdom.</p>

claimed that the eastern boundary should be a line running from Grimington's

run south-westward into 49 degrees north latitude, as by the red line may more
particularly appear, and that that latitude be the limit; that the French do not

then desired His Royal Highness would appoint a day, which he promised
to do. This is what the Regent has promised my Lord Stair once every
week, for four or five months past, without any effect, and his Excellency
does not expect any more from the promise now, though possibly a conference
may be appointed for form sake. I have been here near six
months, and have seen only one conference, which was appointed by my
Lord Stanhope's desire. I think there had been two conferences before I
came; at the first of them the commissions were read, and at the second
my Lord Stair and Mr. Bladen gave in a memorial about the limits of the
Hudson's Bay Company, to which no answer has been made. I must own
that I never could expect much success from this commission, since the
French interests and ours are so directly opposite, and our respective
pretensions interfere so much with each on the several points we were to
treat about; but that the French have not been willing to entertain us
now and then with a conference, and try how far we might be disposed to
comply with a conference, and try how far we might be disposed with any
of the views they had in desiring the commission, cannot, I should think
be accounted for, but by supposing they knew we came prepared to reject
all their demands, and to make very considerable ones for ourselves....
I shall expect your further direction as to my stay or return; I
cannot help owning I heartily wish for the latter, but I shall always
submit to what His Majesty likes best, and shall only desire in this case
that I may have a supply from the treasury, since I have not had the
good fortune to be concerned in either of the Misiseppis.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_68" id="Footnote_68" href="#FNanchor_68"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> France ceded to England "Canada with all its dependencies," reserving
only such part of what had been known as Canada as lay west of the Mississippi.
The watershed between the Missouri and the Mississippi rivers had been the
boundary between Canada and Louisiana when both were owned by France, and
by the treaty of 1763 the River Mississippi was agreed to as the future boundary
between the English and French possessions in that quarter; the language of the
treaty being, "that the confines between [France and England] in that part of
the world shall be fixed irrevocably by a line drawn along the middle of the
River Mississippi from its source [etc.], to the sea." Very soon after this treaty,
viz., on 7th October, 1763, the Province of Quebec was erected by Royal
Proclamation, but the Province as then constituted took in very little of what was
afterwards Upper Canada and what is now Ontario; the most north-westerly
point was Lake Nipissing; the whole of the territory adjacent to the great lakes
was excluded. In 1774 the boundaries of Quebec were enlarged by the Quebec
Act. That Act recited that "by the arrangements made by the said Royal
Proclamation a very large extent of territory, within which were several colonies
and settlements of subjects of France, who claimed to remain therein under the
faith of the said treaty, was left without any provision being made for the
administration of civil government therein." The Act, therefore, provided that
"all the territories, islands and countries in North America belonging to the
Crown of Great Britain, bounded on the south by a line" therein described, "from
the Bay of Chaleurs to the River Ohio, and along the bank of the said river,
westward, to the banks of the Mississippi, and northward to the southern boundary
of the territory granted to the Merchants-Adventurers of England trading
into Hudson's Bay," etc., "be, and they are hereby, during His Majesty's
pleasure, annexed to and made part and parcel of the Province of Quebec as
created and established by the said Royal Proclamation of the 7th October, 1763."</p>

nor Garbet, all of which explorers had visited Marble Island prior to 1767, and
some of them often, ever discovered this harbour. The actual discoverer was
Joseph Stephens, commanding the <i>Success</i>, a small vessel employed in the whale
fishery. Two years later Stephens was given the command of the <i>Charlotte</i>, a fine
brig of 100 tons, his mate then being Samuel Hearne, the explorer.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_70" id="Footnote_70" href="#FNanchor_70"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> "I have seen," wrote Governor Hearne, "the remains of those houses several

copper in that country to the south of the seventy-first degree of latitude, unless it
had been accidentally dropped by some of the far northern Indians on their way
to the Company's factory."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_73" id="Footnote_73" href="#FNanchor_73"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> "This leader," says Hearne, "when a youth, resided several years at the
above Fort and was not only a perfect master of the Southern Indian language,
but by being frequently with the Company's servants had acquired several words
of English and was one of the men who brought the latest accounts of the Coppermine
River. It was on his information, added to that of one I-dot-le-ezry (who is
since dead), that this expedition was set on foot."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_74" id="Footnote_74" href="#FNanchor_74"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> "I cannot sufficiently regret," wrote Hearne in 1796, "the loss of a considerable
vocabulary of the northern Indian language, containing sixteen folio
pages, which was lent to the late Mr. Hutchins, then corresponding secretary to
the Company, to copy for Captain Duncan, when he went on discoveries to
Hudson's Bay in the year 1790. But Mr. Hutchins dying soon after, the vocabulary
was taken away with the rest of his effects and cannot now be recovered, and
memory, at this time, will by no means serve to replace it."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_75" id="Footnote_75" href="#FNanchor_75"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> The Company had previously written thus to its servant, Mr.

<p class="footnote">We have, naturally, considered your great assiduity in the various

attached to it for a horizon, and made by Daniel Scatlif, of Wapping."&mdash;<i>Hearne.</i></p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_80" id="Footnote_80" href="#FNanchor_80"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> "What folly," asks one of the Company's servants, "could be more egregious
than to erect a fort of such extent, strength and expense and only allow thirty-nine
men to defend it?"</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_81" id="Footnote_81" href="#FNanchor_81"><span class="label">[81]</span></a> An account of Hearne's journey was found in MS. among the papers of the
Governor, and La Pérouse declares in his memoirs that Hearne was very pressing
that it should be returned to him as his private property. "The goodness of La
Pérouse's heart induced him to yield to this urgent solicitation, and he returned
the MS. to him on the express condition, however, that he should print and
publish it immediately on his arrival in England." "Notwithstanding this,"
observes Mr. Fitzgerald, "Hearne's travels did not appear until 1795, <i>i.e.</i>,
twenty-three years after they were performed." This gentleman, so distinguished
in his zeal to prove a case against the Company, evidently overlooks the circumstance
of the gist of travels having been issued in pamphlet form in 1773 and
again in 1778-80. The volume of 1795 was merely an application&mdash;the product
of Hearne's leisure upon retirement.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_83" id="Footnote_83" href="#FNanchor_83"><span class="label">[83]</span></a> Of David Thompson we get a portrait from Mr. H. H. Bancroft. He was,
he says, "of an entirely different order of man from the orthodox fur-trader.
Tall and fine looking, with sandy complexion, with large features, deep-set
studious eyes, high forehead and broad shoulders, the intellectual was set upon
the physical. His deeds have never been trumpeted as have those of some of the
others; but in the westward explorations of the North-West Company, no man
performed more valuable service or estimated his achievements more modestly.
Unhappily his last days were not as pleasant as fell to the lot of some of the worn
out members of the Company. He retired, almost blind, to Lachine House,
once the headquarters of the Company, where he was met with in 1831 in a very
decrepit condition."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_85" id="Footnote_85" href="#FNanchor_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> To exhibit anew the exaggeration common to the acquisition of new possessions,
I may observe that Shelekoff reported that he had subjected to the crown
of Russia, "fifty thousand men in the Island of Kodiak alone." But Lisiansky,
who took a prominent part in the Russian Company, remarks, in 1805, that "the
population of the island, when compared with its size, is very small." After the
"minutest research" at that time he found it amounted to only four thousand
souls.</p>

the posts occupied in the Indian country (exclusive of the King's posts), the number
of partners, clerks and men employed, the latitude and longitude of each
post being also given. The grand total shows that there were 117 posts, 20
partners, 161 clerks and interpreters, 877 common men, in all of a permanent
staff 1,058 men, thus divided: Ninety-five in the territory of the United States
from the south side of Lake Superior to the division of the waters falling into
the Mississippi on the one side and Hudson's Bay on the other; seventy-six on
the waters falling into the St. Lawrence from the Kaministiquia, and also from the
St. Maurice; six hundred and thirty on the waters falling into Hudson's Bay, and
two hundred and fifty-seven on the waters falling into the North Sea by the
Mackenzie River. Besides these there were eighty or one hundred Canadians and
Iroquois hunters, not servants, ranging free over the country and about five hundred
and forty men employed in canoes on the Ottawa River. The average duties
paid annually on landing in Britain amounted to upwards of £22,000 sterling and
the price paid for the furs exported from Quebec in 1801, at the London sales, was
£371,139 11s. 4d.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_89" id="Footnote_89" href="#FNanchor_89"><span class="label">[89]</span></a> It has been noted that several partners of the North-West concern were
upon the grand jury which found the bill of indictment, and out of four judges who
sat upon the bench, two were nearly related to individuals of that association.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_90" id="Footnote_90" href="#FNanchor_90"><span class="label">[90]</span></a> Already, in April, 1802, Lord Selkirk had addressed a letter and memorial
to Lord Pelham, the Home Secretary, detailing the practicability of promoting
emigration to Rupert's Land. "To a colony in these territories," he concluded,
"the channel of trade must be the river of Port Nelson."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_91" id="Footnote_91" href="#FNanchor_91"><span class="label">[91]</span></a> In the course of a letter reporting on the disputes between the Hudson's
Bay Company and the North-Westers, Commissioner Coltman attributed the disasters
in the territories to the Company having held in abeyance its right to jurisdiction
and that this neglect was the reason for passing the act of 1803. This
letter is in the Canadian Archives, <i>v.</i> Report 1892.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_92" id="Footnote_92" href="#FNanchor_92"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> "I have," writes Sir Alexander Mackenzie from London, 13th April, 1812,
"finally settled with that Lord (Selkirk). After having prepared a bill to carry
him before the Lord Chancellor, it was proposed to my solicitor by the solicitor of
his Lordship that one-third of the stock that was purchased on joint account
before I went to America, amounting to £47,000, and the balance of cash in his
Lordship's hands, belonging to me, should be given up to me; of this I accepted,
though I might have obliged his Lordship to make over to me one-third of the
whole purchase made by him in this stock, which at one time I was determined to
do, having been encouraged thereto by the house of Suffolk Lane and countenanced
by that of Mark Lane. But these houses thought it prudent to desist from
any further purchases."</p>

<p class="footnote">Mackenzie says that by a verbal understanding with Mr. McGillivray, his
purchase of the Hudson's Bay stock belonged to the North-West Company, and
that, if Mr. McGillivray himself had been there, a sum of £30,000 might have
been invested in that stock, "all of which Lord Selkirk purchased, and if he
persists in his present scheme, it will be the dearest he yet made.</p>

<p class="footnote">"He will put the North-West Company to a greater expense than you seem to
apprehend, and had the Company sacrificed £20,000 which might have secured a
preponderance in the stock of Hudson's Bay Co., it would have been money well
spent."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_93" id="Footnote_93" href="#FNanchor_93"><span class="label">[93]</span></a> The district thus granted was called Assiniboia, a name undoubtedly derived
from the Assiniboine tribe and river, yet alleged by some at the time to be taken
from two Gaelic words "osni" and "boia"&mdash;the house of Ossian.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_94" id="Footnote_94" href="#FNanchor_94"><span class="label">[94]</span></a> "None of the young men," says McDonnell, "made any progress in learning
the Gaelic or Irish language on the voyage. I had some drills of the people with
arms, but the weather was generally boisterous, and there were few days when a
person could stand steady on deck. There never was a more awkward squad&mdash;not
a man, or even officer, of the party knew how to put a gun to his eye or had
ever fired a shot."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_95" id="Footnote_95" href="#FNanchor_95"><span class="label">[95]</span></a> Governor McDonnell's observations are not always to be relied upon. For
instance, he says in one report, "I am surprised the Company never directed a
survey to be made of the coast on each side of Hudson's Straits. From the
appearance of the country there must be many harbours and inlets for vessels to
go in case of an accident from ice, want of water, etc. We were often, ourselves,
much in doubt for the accomplishment of our voyage, and had we been under
the necessity of putting back, must have suffered for want of water. Two of the
ships, without any additional expense, might execute this survey on the voyage
out, with only the detention of a few days, one taking the north and the other the
south shore." Such a survey had been made as early as 1728. Mention has
already been made of Captain Coats, who, in 1739, prepared a chart of the Straits
and Bay. To some of the older captains in the service, the Straits were as well-known
as the harbour of Stromness.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_96" id="Footnote_96" href="#FNanchor_96"><span class="label">[96]</span></a> The precise spot was well chosen by Selkirk, had his object been only the
confusion and discomfiture of the North-Westers. It was the great depot of the
latter for the preparation of pemmican. Were the region to become colonized it
would slowly but surely cut off the buffalo, from which pemmican was made, and
eventually force the North-Westers to import from Canada, at ruinous expense,
the chief part of the provisions requisite for their trading expeditions.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_97" id="Footnote_97" href="#FNanchor_97"><span class="label">[97]</span></a> In honour of William McGillivray, principal partner of the concern.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_98" id="Footnote_98" href="#FNanchor_98"><span class="label">[98]</span></a> "It will never do," wrote Governor McDonnell to his chief, "to take the
colonists from among the Company's servants. The Orkneymen are so averse to
labour that they prefer the Company's service to agriculture, and all being
engaged in the name of the Company they object to serve in the colony, thinking
it a separate concern."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_99" id="Footnote_99" href="#FNanchor_99"><span class="label">[99]</span></a> There is preserved a letter from the leader of the Bois-Brulés, written to
one of the partners. It bears date of 13th of March, 1816, and runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="footnote">
My Dear Sir: I received your generous and kind letter of last fall by the
last canoe. I should certainly be an ungrateful being should I not return you my
sincerest thanks. Although a very bad hand at writing letters I trust to your
generosity. I am yet safe and sound, thank God! For I believe it is more than
Colin Robertson, or any of his suit dare to offer the least insult to any of the Bois-Brulés,
although Robertson made use of some expressions which I hope he shall
swallow in the spring; he shall see that it is neither fifteen, thirty nor fifty of your
best horsemen can make the Bois-Brulés bow to him. Our people of Fort des
Prairies and English River are all to be here in the spring. It is hoped we shall
come off with flying colours, and never to see any of them again in the colonizing
way in Red River; in fact the traders shall pack off with themselves, also, for
having disobeyed our orders last spring, according to our arrangements. We are
all to remain at the Forks to pass the summer, for fear they should play us the
same trick as last summer, of coming back; but they shall receive a warm reception.
I am loath to enter into any particulars, as I am well assured that you will
receive more satisfactory information (than I have had) from your other correspondents;
therefore I shall not pretend to give you any, at the same time begging
you will excuse my short letter, I shall conclude, wishing you health and
happiness.</p>

<p class="left45 s09">
I shall ever remain,<br />
<span class="i4">Your most obedient humble servant,</span><br />
<span class="smcap i8">Cuthbert Grant</span>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_100" id="Footnote_100" href="#FNanchor_100"><span class="label">[100]</span></a> This messenger, Lagimoniere by name, was waylaid and robbed by the North-Westers.
He had previously made a hazardous winter journey of upwards of
2,000 miles for the purpose of bringing to Montreal intelligence of the re-establishment
of the Red River Colony. He was now attacked near Fond du Lac by some
native hunters employed by the North-West Company, who beat him in a shocking
manner, besides plundering him of his despatches, his canoe and all his effects.
The order to intercept him was issued on the 2nd of June by Norman McLeod
from Fort William; and the Indians who performed the service were credited in
the books of the partnership with the sum of $100. Several of Lord Selkirk's
letters were afterwards discovered at Fort William.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_101" id="Footnote_101" href="#FNanchor_101"><span class="label">[101]</span></a> Semple is said, on the authority of an eye-witness, Donald Murray, yet living
in 1891 (when a monument was erected to commemorate the Red River tragedy),
to have disapproved of Robertson's management during his absence. This veteran
was fond of relating that when Robertson started for York Factory in a boat,
taking Duncan Cameron a prisoner, he insultingly hoisted a pemmican sack
instead of the British flag.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_102" id="Footnote_102" href="#FNanchor_102"><span class="label">[102]</span></a> The route taken by the Bois-Brulés was along the edge of the swamps, about
two miles out on the prairie from Fort Douglas, and from that point gradually
drawing nearer to the main highway, which is now the northern continuation of
Winnipeg's Main street, until it effected a junction at a spot known as Seven Oaks.
The name was derived from the circumstance of seven good sized oak trees
growing there, about one hundred yards south of a small rivulet, now known as
Inkster's Creek.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_103" id="Footnote_103" href="#FNanchor_103"><span class="label">[103]</span></a> Their being painted and disguised, forms a very material fact, because it shows
a premeditation to commit hostilities. It was not the custom of the Indians or
Bois-Brulés to paint themselves, except on warlike occasions. Seeing this party
of horsemen were proceeding towards the settlement, Semple directed about
twenty men to follow him in the direction they had taken to ascertain what was
their object. These took arms with them, but no ammunition. That Semple and
his party went out with no hostile intention is evident from there being but twenty
who went, whereas a much greater number who could have gone and were desirous
of going, were left behind.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_104" id="Footnote_104" href="#FNanchor_104"><span class="label">[104]</span></a> After the tragedy many of the settlers are said to have been of the opinion
that the first shot was fired by Lieut. Holt, whose gun went off by accident, thus
precipitating the conflict.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_105" id="Footnote_105" href="#FNanchor_105"><span class="label">[105]</span></a> While the affair was sufficiently horrible, there was yet room for exaggeration
in the tales of the survivors. "On my arrival at the fort," declared Pritchard,
"what a scene of distress presented itself! The widows, children and relations of
the slain, in the horrors of despair, were lamenting the dead and trembling for the
safety of the survivors." It is to be noted that only one actual settler was killed,
and I cannot discover that the others had any white women-folk amongst them.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_106" id="Footnote_106" href="#FNanchor_106"><span class="label">[106]</span></a> Benjamin Frobisher was a native of York, England.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_107" id="Footnote_107" href="#FNanchor_107"><span class="label">[107]</span></a> At the trials at York in October, 1818, Sherwood, the North-West Company's
counsel, continually demanded to know why Semple was called governor.
"Why," he exclaimed, with ludicrous energy, "why should this gentleman be
continually dignified by the appellation of governor? The indictment charged
that Robert Semple was killed and murdered; it said nothing about his being a
governor. If he was a governor, then he was also an emperor. Yes, gentlemen,"
shrieked the counsel, working himself up to fever heat, "I repeat, an
emperor&mdash;a bashaw in that land of milk and honey, where nothing, not even a
blade of corn, will ripen. Who made him governor? Did the King? Did the
Prince Regent? No; this pretended authority was an illegal assumption of
power, arrogating to itself prerogatives such as are not exercised even by the
King of England. I demand that Robert Semple be called Robert Semple&mdash;but
as he was not a governor let us not be &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="footnote">"Come, come," cried Chief Justice Powell, "do let this trial go on! It is no
matter whether he was or was not a governor, or what he was called, or called
himself, he is not to be murdered, though he was not a governor."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_108" id="Footnote_108" href="#FNanchor_108"><span class="label">[108]</span></a> "Ses postes," says Senator Masson, "avient été pillés et devastés; ses
exportatiors considerablement sédintes." On the other hand, he adds, these
losses were partly compensated for by the high prices secured in England for
their furs.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_110" id="Footnote_110" href="#FNanchor_110"><span class="label">[110]</span></a> In March, 1821, Wentzel, one of the North-West partners, wrote: "The
Hudson's Bay Company have apparently relaxed in the extravagance of their
measures; last autumn they came in the [Athabasca] Department with fifteen
canoes only, containing each about fifteen pieces. Mr. Simpson, a gentleman
from England last spring, superintends their business. His being a strange,
and reputedly gentlemanly, man, will not create much alarm, nor do I presume
him formidable as an Indian trader."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_112" id="Footnote_112" href="#FNanchor_112"><span class="label">[112]</span></a> "Such is the spirit and avidity exhibited by the Council," wrote one of the
Company's factors, in 1823, "that it is believed these discoveries will be extended
as far as the Russian settlements on the Pacific Ocean."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_113" id="Footnote_113" href="#FNanchor_113"><span class="label">[113]</span></a> On motion of Mr. Congressman Floyd, a committee was appointed in
December, 1820, "to enquire into the situation of the settlements upon the Pacific
Ocean, and the expediency of occupying the Columbia River."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_114" id="Footnote_114" href="#FNanchor_114"><span class="label">[114]</span></a> See <a href="#Alaska">Appendix</a> for copy of this Treaty.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_115" id="Footnote_115" href="#FNanchor_115"><span class="label">[115]</span></a> The Russian Company was incorporated under the patronage of the Crown
with a capital of two hundred and sixty thousand pounds sterling. It had a large
commerce with Northern China which did not deal with Canton; and it was in
the northern part of the empire that the consumption of furs was greatest. Canton
was merely the <i>entrepôt</i> where furs were received for distribution throughout
China.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_116" id="Footnote_116" href="#FNanchor_116"><span class="label">[116]</span></a> From Joseph Berens, Esq., the Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company
and the gentlemen of the Committee, I received all kinds of assistance and
information, communicated in the most friendly manner previous to my leaving
England; and I had the gratification of perusing the orders to their agents and
servants in North America, containing the fullest directions to promote by every
means the progress of the expedition.&mdash;<i>Sir John Franklin.</i></p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_117" id="Footnote_117" href="#FNanchor_117"><span class="label">[117]</span></a> "The extraordinary expedition with which this despatch was transmitted by
the Hudson's Bay Company," says Back, "is worthy of being recorded."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_118" id="Footnote_118" href="#FNanchor_118"><span class="label">[118]</span></a> Indeed it cannot be doubted that Great Britain was wholly influenced by the
position of the Company. It has been said that she did not anticipate any
permanent possession of the country. "The British have certainly no other
immediate object," wrote Mr. Gallatin, the American commissioner, to Henry
Clay, "than that of protecting the Company in its fur-trade."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_119" id="Footnote_119" href="#FNanchor_119"><span class="label">[119]</span></a> Sir Edward Walkin tells how, when he was for a short time, in 1865 and
1866, shareholders' auditor of the Company, he cancelled many of these notes
which had become defaced, mainly owing to the fingering of Indians and others,
who had left behind on the thick yellow paper, coatings of pemmican.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_120" id="Footnote_120" href="#FNanchor_120"><span class="label">[120]</span></a> Lord Elgin went on to say: "At the same time I think it is to be regretted
that a jurisdiction so extensive and peculiar, exercised by British subjects at such
a distance and so far beyond the control of public opinion, should be so entirely
removed from the surveillance of Her Majesty's Government. The evil arising
from this state of things is forcibly illustrated in the present instance by the
difficulty which I experience in obtaining materials for a full and satisfactory
report on the charges which your Lordship referred to me. It were very desirable,
if abuses do exist, that Government possessed the means of probing them to
the bottom; and on the other hand it seems to be hard on the Company, if the
imputations cast upon it be unfounded, that Government, which undertakes the
investigation, should not have the power of acquitting it on testimony more
unexceptionable than any which is at present procurable. It has been stated to
me that your Lordship has it in contemplation to establish a military officer at
some point within the territories of the Company, and that the Company is disposed
to afford every facility for carrying out this arrangement. I trust that this report
may prove to be well founded."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_121" id="Footnote_121" href="#FNanchor_121"><span class="label">[121]</span></a> The treaty having provided for a joint commission, Mr. A. S. Johnston and
the Hon. (afterwards Sir) John Rose were appointed to act for America and Great
Britain, respectively. These commissioners, on the 10th of September, 1869,
issued an award from Washington, directing the payment of $450,000 by the
United States to the Hudson's Bay Company, and $200,000 to the Puget's Sound
Company. There was, as usual, considerable delay in making this payment. On
the 11th of July, 1870, $325,000 was appropriated by Congress for this purpose,
and a like sum by another appropriation in the following year.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_122" id="Footnote_122" href="#FNanchor_122"><span class="label">[122]</span></a> "I am glad to tell you that since I received your letter of Saturday last, the
Hudson's Bay Company has replied to my communication; and has promised to
<i>grant</i> land to a Company formed under such auspices as those with whom I
placed them in communication. The question now is, what <i>breadth</i> of land they
will give, for of course they propose to include the whole length of the line
through their territory. A copy of the reply shall be sent to Mr. Baring, and I
hope you and he will be able to bring this concession to some practical issue.</p>

<p class="footnote">"I was quite aware of the willingness of the Company to <i>sell</i> their <i>whole</i> rights
for some such sum as £1,500,000. I ascertained the fact two months ago
and alluded to it in the House of Lords in my reply to a motion by Lord
Donoughmore. I cannot, however, view the proposal in so favourable a light as
you do. There would be no immediate or <i>direct</i> return to show for this large
outlay, for of course the trade monopoly must cease, and the sale of the land
would for some time bring in little or nothing&mdash;certainly not enough to pay for
the government of the country.</p>

<p class="footnote">"I do not think Canada <i>can</i>, or if she can, ought to take any large share
in such a payment. Some of her politicians would no doubt support the
proposal with views of their own&mdash;but it would be a serious, and for some time
unrenumerative addition to their very embarassing debt. I certainly should not
like to <i>sell</i> any portion of the territory to the United States&mdash;<i>exchange</i> (if the
territory were once acquired) would be a different thing&mdash;but that would not help
towards the liquidation of the purchase money."&mdash;<i>Letter of the Duke of Newcastle,
14th August, 1862.</i></p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_123" id="Footnote_123" href="#FNanchor_123"><span class="label">[123]</span></a> "To my mind the worst feature in the new Company is that of allowing a
foreigner (American) to hold office. He owes allegiance to the United States,
and his position gives him knowledge which no American should possess. 'Blood
is thicker than water,' says the proverb: 'No man can serve two masters.' As
to the idea that being in the fur-trade his experience and influence will benefit the
new Company, will any furrier believe that? If the Company will sell all the
furs, I would never rest satisfied while an American was in the management.'"&mdash;William
McNaughten, the Company's agent at New York.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_126" id="Footnote_126" href="#FNanchor_126"><span class="label">[126]</span></a> "With regard to the Hudson's Bay matter," wrote Cartier to Watkin,
under date of 15th of February, 1868, "not the least doubt that the speech of
'John A.,' was very uncalled for and injudicious. He had no business to make
such a speech, and I told him so at the time&mdash;that he ought not to have made it.
However, you must not attach too much importance to that speech. I myself,
and several of my colleagues, and John A. himself, have no intention to commit
any spoliation; and for myself in particular, I can say to you that I will never
consent to be a party to a measure or anything intended to be an act of spoliation
of the Hudson's Bay's rights and privileges."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_127" id="Footnote_127" href="#FNanchor_127"><span class="label">[127]</span></a> "The present state of government in the Red River settlement is attributable
alike to the habitual attempt encouraged, perhaps very naturally, in England and
in Canada, to discredit the tradition and question the title of the Hudson's Bay
Company, and to the false economy which has stripped the Governor of a military
force, with which, in the last resort, to support the decisions of the legal tribunals.
No other organized government of white men in the world, since William Penn,
has endeavoured to rule any population, still less a promiscuous people composed
of whites, half-breeds, Indians and borderers, without a soldiery of some sort, and
the inevitable result of the experiment has, in this case, been an unpunished case of
prison-breaking, not sympathized in, it is true, by the majority of the settlers,
but still tending to bring law and government into contempt, and greatly to
discourage the governing body held responsible for keeping order in the territory."&mdash;<i>Governor
Dallas.</i></p>

warning had been given to the Dominion Government of the state of feeling

politician."</p>

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

</ul>

<p>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
